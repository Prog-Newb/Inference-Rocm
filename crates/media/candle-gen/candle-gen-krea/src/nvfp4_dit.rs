//! The **NVFP4 precision seam** for the Krea 2 single-stream DiT trunk (sc-12110, epic 11037).
//!
//! [`crate::transformer::Krea2Transformer`] loads its projections through
//! [`crate::loader::linear_detect`] by default — dense bf16, or the MLX-packed q4/q8 dequant-on-forward
//! [`crate::quant::QLinear`]. This module adds the seam that lets the SAME trunk serve those projections
//! through [`candle_gen::quant::Nvfp4Linear`] instead — the sc-11041 packed-forward NVFP4 path — so a **real Krea 2 Turbo
//! denoise** can be run end-to-end on the FP4 tensor cores and compared against both epic baselines.
//!
//! This is a direct port of `candle-gen-sana`'s `nvfp4_dit` (sc-11045), which established the pattern.
//! Krea is the epic's **validation vehicle** (sc-12110): Michael redirected SC#1/SC#2 here because
//! SANA's Mix-FFN is convolutional — its linears are 0.20% of block time, capping any end-to-end
//! multiple at ~1.002× — whereas **Krea's DiT is 100% linear GEMM with zero `Conv2d`**, so the NVFP4
//! lane reaches essentially all parameterized compute.
//!
//! Three things live here:
//!
//! 1. [`DitPlan`] — how to serve the trunk's projections: the byte-unchanged default (dense/packed via
//!    `linear_detect`), or NVFP4 under a [`Nvfp4Quant`] regime (the sc-11038 per-layer mixed policy, or
//!    a blanket W4A4/W4A16 for a controlled bench).
//! 2. [`LayerRole`] — the structural facts about a projection that its dotted key cannot carry,
//!    threaded from the loader (which knows the trunk's topology) into the shared substring policy.
//! 3. [`ActProbe`] — a per-layer, per-step **activation-outlier sparsity** recorder, so the
//!    benign→W4A4 / outlier→W4A16 partition can be re-derived against **Krea's** naming from live
//!    activations rather than inherited from SANA's.
//!
//! # Why Krea needs [`LayerRole`] more than SANA did
//!
//! The shared policy ([`candle_gen::quant::ActPrecision::for_outlier_layer_with`]) is substring-based and was tuned on
//! SANA's diffusers naming. **Three of its anchors do not exist in Krea's checkpoint**, and every gap
//! fails in the *unsafe* direction (an outlier-carrying layer silently landing on W4A4):
//!
//! * **`attn2` / `cross_att*`** — Krea has **no cross-attention at all**. It is a *single-stream* DiT:
//!   the fused text context is **concatenated onto the image token sequence** (`combined = [ctx ; img]`)
//!   and read by ordinary self-attention. There is no projection named `attn2` to guard.
//! * **`caption_projection`** — Krea's text→DiT ingest is named `txt_in.linear_{1,2}`, fed by the
//!   `text_fusion` stack that aggregates the raw Qwen3-VL hidden states. Neither matches.
//! * **`proj_out`** — Krea's trunk head is `final_layer.linear`. `names_final_proj` cannot fire on it.
//!   (Krea's *only* `proj_out` is a control-branch layer nested under `blocks.{i}`, which the anchor
//!   correctly declines — verified, and the reason the anchor is safe to leave alone here.)
//!
//! So Krea states these facts explicitly through [`LayerRole`] rather than sharpening substrings
//! until they happen to fit a second provider — the seam sc-11045 built for exactly this, and the lesson
//! sc-12140 records. **Measured vindication:** `final_layer.linear` really does measure
//! [`candle_gen::quant::OutlierClass::Dense`] on real activations (crush **909×**). It is guarded *only* because the loader
//! states [`LayerRole::final_proj`]; the name-only anchor would have left it on W4A4.
//!
//! # The finding that is not about naming at all (sc-12110)
//!
//! Measuring the real trunk did not just expose naming gaps — it refuted the policy's underlying
//! *model* of where massive activations live. The sc-11038 policy assumes they arrive with the
//! **caption** and can be contained by guarding a named block. On Krea, the first measurement under
//! that assumption gave **209 layers at W4A4, of which 59 measured Dense** — and the violations were
//! concentrated in the compute bulk, not the caption path:
//!
//! * **`ff.down` was Dense in 28/28 blocks** and **`attn.to_out.0` in 21/28** — 45 of the 59. Both read
//!   a **post-nonlinearity intermediate** (`silu(gate(x))·up(x)`; `attn_out·sigmoid(gate(x))`), i.e. a
//!   product of two unbounded branches with no normalization before the next GEMM.
//! * Every projection reading a **normalized block input** (`attn.to_{q,k,v,gate}`, `ff.{gate,up}`) was
//!   benign from block 4 onward.
//!
//! So the real rule on Krea is **normalized inputs are benign; post-nonlinearity intermediates are
//! not** — orthogonal to captions, and invisible on SANA because SANA's FFN is a `GLUMBConv` and never
//! entered the linear lane. That is [`LayerRole::is_post_nonlinearity`], and it is why the partition is
//! re-derived here by measurement instead of inherited.
//!
//! **What is and is not quantized.** The seam covers the trunk's GEMM projections: the 28 single-stream
//! blocks' `attn.{to_q,to_k,to_v,to_gate,to_out.0}` + `ff.{gate,up,down}`, the `text_fusion`
//! layerwise/refiner blocks' equivalents, `img_in`, `txt_in.linear_{1,2}` and `final_layer.linear` —
//! 260 projections on Krea 2 Turbo. It deliberately does **not** cover:
//!
//! * the timestep / modulation embedders (`time_embed.linear_{1,2}`, `time_mod_proj`), whose `[B, …]`
//!   batch-1 shapes give the FP4 GEMM nothing to win while M-padding to 16 would dominate (the same
//!   exclusion SANA made);
//! * `text_fusion.projector`, a `[1, num_layers]` collapse whose `N = 1` is ineligible for the cuBLASLt
//!   FP4 path anyway (it would fall back at runtime; excluding it keeps the report honest).
//!
//! Everything degrades cleanly: an [`candle_gen::quant::Nvfp4Linear`] on a non-`sm_120` device, on CPU, or on a non-cuda
//! build transparently serves the dequant→bf16 fallback (sc-11041), so a `DitPlan::nvfp4(..)` trunk
//! still *runs* everywhere — it just does not light the FP4 cores. That is the SC#4 Blackwell-only
//! gate, observed at model level by [`Nvfp4Report::fp4_lit`].
