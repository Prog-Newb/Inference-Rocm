//! Krea 2's per-step latent preview seam (epic 16948, sc-16950) — the candle twin of `mlx-gen-krea`'s
//! `KreaPreview`.
//!
//! Krea keeps its denoise state in the **spatial** QwenVae layout `[1, 16, H/8, W/8]` at every step of
//! every route, so wiring a preview here is two things and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. a projector closure over [`candle_gen_qwen_image::preview::project_spatial_latents`] — the
//!    epic-16624 fit, **reused** rather than refitted (see that module for the tensor-byte grounding);
//! 2. handing that closure to [`candle_gen::run_flow_sampler`] as a [`PreviewHook`], which already
//!    owns per-step numbering, multi-eval dedup, and the swallow-on-failure contract (sc-16949).
//!
//! No route restructures its loop, and no route unpacks anything: `unpack_latents` is a Qwen-Image /
//! FLUX.2 concern, not a Krea one.
//!
//! ## What the hook does and does not see
//!
//! The sampler drivers hand the hook the **running latent** `x`, which for Krea is always the single
//! `[1, 16, H/8, W/8]` target trajectory:
//!
//! * **CFG is invisible here.** Krea's true-CFG routes (Raw t2i/img2img, Raw edit, CFG multi-phase)
//!   run the conditional and unconditional forwards *inside* the predict closure and combine them with
//!   [`crate::pipeline::krea_cfg_combine`] before returning a single velocity. There is no fused
//!   `[2, …]` batch anywhere in the sampler, so the preview cannot project an unconditional half even
//!   by accident.
//! * **Edit references are invisible here.** `forward_edit_with_memory` concatenates the VAE-encoded
//!   reference latents into the DiT sequence internally; `x` stays the target alone. A preview of a
//!   Reference / MultiReference edit is therefore a preview of the image being generated, not of a
//!   reference.
//!
//! Both properties are structural rather than defensive, and
//! [`tests::sampler_hook_only_ever_sees_the_single_target_latent`] pins them against a predict closure
//! that fuses a CFG batch and concatenates references the way the real routes do.
//!
//! ## Numbering across a sliced schedule
//!
//! Every route but one drives a single [`candle_gen::run_flow_sampler`] call per image and takes the
//! driver's numbering. Multi-phase Raw resolves ONE global schedule and drives a call per phase over
//! `sigmas[start..=end]`, so it builds a global [`PreviewCounter`] with [`multiphase_hook`] and the
//! frames stay `1..=total` across phase boundaries — matching `mlx-gen-krea`.
