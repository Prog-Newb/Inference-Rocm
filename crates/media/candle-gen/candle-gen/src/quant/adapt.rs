//! Shared residual-capable linear for the **forward-time additive (unmerged) LoRA / LoKr** path
//! (sc-11091, epic 10765) — the one core [`AdaptLinear`] that the per-crate copies in
//! `candle-gen-wan/src/quant.rs` (sc-10094) and `candle-gen-anima/src/adapt.rs` (sc-10640) collapse
//! into, and the first-class seam a new consumer (qwen-image-edit Lightning on a packed q4/q8 tier)
//! adopts instead of hand-copying a third time. The candle twin of mlx-gen's `AdaptableLinear`.
//!
//! A frozen **base** — dense (`candle_nn::Linear`) or an MLX-**packed** [`super::QLinear`] that
//! dequantizes-on-forward (sc-7702) — plus zero or more **forward-time additive residuals**
//! `y = base(x) + Σ scale·((x·A)·B)`. Two residual forms, both **memory-free on a packed tier**:
//!   * `Lora` — `scale·((x·a)·b)`, two small matmuls (`a = downᵀ [in,rank]`, `b = upᵀ·(alpha/rank)
//!     [rank,out]`); never the `[out,in]` product, so a q4 base keeps its q4 footprint.
//!   * `LokrStructured` — the Kronecker vec-trick `vec(w1·reshape(x)·w2ᵀ)` (the candle port of
//!     mlx-gen's `Adapter::LokrStructured`), which applies a LoKr WITHOUT ever forming the `[out,in]`
//!     delta — the one path Wan's old copy lacked (it fell back to a dense `[out,in]` delta, packed-
//!     rejected).
//!
//! **The base weight is NEVER mutated.** On a packed q4/q8 DiT that is the whole point: the packed
//! codes survive load (`is_packed()` stays true, no dense `[out,in]` weight is materialized), and each
//! adapter rides *unmerged* as small matmuls per forward. On a **dense** base the fold path
//! ([`crate::train::merge`]) is still preferred for real runs, because a merge into a real `.weight`
//! is byte-for-byte what the chaos-sensitive samplers' goldens expect (`(W+δ)·x ≠ W·x + δ·x` to ~1
//! ULP — see [`crate::train::lora::reconstruct_lora_delta`]); the additive branch equals the fold to
//! f32 tolerance and is the *only* viable path where a merge is impossible (a quant-resident weight).
//! With **no** adapter attached the forward is byte-identical to the bare base, so swapping this in for
//! a projection leaves the plain-model / dense-fold paths unchanged.
