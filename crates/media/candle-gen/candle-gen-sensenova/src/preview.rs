//! SenseNova-U1's per-step preview seam (epic 16948, sc-16960) — the epic's **Tier 2** family, and
//! the only one that needed a fit of its own rather than a reuse.
//!
//! Schedule numbering, dedup and the swallow-on-failure contract live in [`candle_gen::preview`],
//! shared by every candle family (sc-16949). This module owns three things: the fit, the pool that
//! takes the running state to the grid the fit was measured on, and the layout check that says the
//! tensor being projected is this family's.
//!
//! ## SenseNova-U1 has **no VAE** — the premise this story was scoped on is false, and that is the
//! whole reason the measurement came out where it did
//!
//! Epic 16948 filed this story as "SenseNova-U1 has its own VAE and MLX never fitted it". The first
//! half is wrong. `crate`'s own module docs already say so — *"there is no separate VAE or text
//! encoder"* — and the sources agree end to end: `config.json` carries no autoencoder section at all,
//! [`crate::T2iModel`] loads `language_model.*` + `fm_modules.*` and nothing else, and its
//! flow-matching head predicts `3·(patch·merge)²` values per token, which `crate::fm::unpatchify`
//! folds straight back into `[1, 3, H, W]`.
//!
//! **SenseNova-U1 denoises in pixel space.** The running state of the bespoke loop *is* the image, in
//! the model's own `[-1, 1]` space, and the "decode" is the affine map `crate::t2i::tensor_to_image`
//! applies: `x·0.5 + 0.5`, clamped. There is no encoder, no latent channel expansion, and nothing to
//! recover before projecting.
//!
//! Two consequences, both load-bearing:
//!
//! * **This space cannot be one of the seven epic-16624 fitted spaces**, and the reason is structural
//!   rather than a hash comparison: those are 4-, 16- and 32-channel VAE latents, and this is a
//!   **3**-channel pixel space belonging to a checkpoint that ships no autoencoder. A reuse was never
//!   available here, which is what put this family in Tier 2 in the first place.
//! * **The fit is near-exact, and that is a result rather than an escape.** Because the decode is
//!   affine, an ordinary-least-squares map from the state to the decoded pixels can recover it
//!   essentially perfectly; the only thing that stops it being exactly perfect is the clamp, which is
//!   the one non-linearity in the path. The measurement is reported honestly for what it is — see
//!   `RGB_FACTORS` (private, hence no link) and
//!   `docs/migration/evidence/sc-16960-sensenova-candle-preview.md` — and `tests/fit_preview_rgb.rs`
//!   is the producer that derived it, on real weights, with a disjoint holdout that never contributed
//!   a coefficient.
//!
//! ## The preview grid is the model's own token grid
//!
//! [`crate::T2iModel::cell`] = `patch_size · merge_size` = **32** for the shipped 8B-MoT
//! checkpoint, and one backbone token is exactly one `cell × cell` pixel patch — the FM head predicts
//! `3 · cell²` numbers per token. So `H/cell × W/cell` is SenseNova's own latent granularity, not a
//! downsample this module invented, and a 1024² render previews at 32×32 for the same reason SANA's
//! `f32` DC-AE does.
//!
//! [`project_running_image`] therefore average-pools the running `[1, 3, H, W]` state by `cell` before
//! projecting. That pool is **the same average the fit's target uses**, so the projector operates in
//! precisely the space the coefficients were measured in.
//!
//! One consequence worth stating because it inverts the usual diagnostic: pooling 32×32 = 1024
//! independent noise samples divides the prior's standard deviation by 32, so SenseNova's **first
//! frame is not a noise field — it is near-flat grey**, and its rail-clipped fraction is ~0 where a
//! VAE family's would be large. Rail-clipping is not the discriminating statistic here; **contrast
//! about the intercept** is, and `tests/preview_real_weights.rs` measures that one instead.
//!
//! ## What a frame can and cannot contain
//!
//! * **CFG never reaches a frame.** The bespoke `denoise` loop runs the unconditional pass as a
//!   *second forward against a second KV cache* inside the step body and blends the two velocities
//!   into one `v_pred` before `crate::fm::euler_step` advances the state. No fused `[2, …]` batch is
//!   ever the running image, so there is no unconditional half to project.
//! * **Text tokens never reach a frame.** The prompt lives entirely in the prefilled KV cache; the
//!   running state is the image grid alone.
//! * **The registered it2i path shares this projector.** Its running state has the same pixel-space
//!   layout as txt2img and forwards the request hook into the shared dual-guidance loop. The direct
//!   preview-aware interleave API takes a caller-supplied hook too. Its source-compatible legacy
//!   wrapper deliberately supplies an inert hook because that older API has no preview carrier; this
//!   never replaces the registered request's sink.
//!
//! A stale or absent fit degrades preview colour only; the denoise path never reads these constants.
