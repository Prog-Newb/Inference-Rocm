///
/// ## Why the ported MLX guard is not enough on its own
///
/// The MLX guard compares two things that are both hand-maintained: an allowlist of ids and the
/// `supports_preview` flags on the descriptors. That pins the two lists to each other, which is
/// worth having — a descriptor cannot advertise without a deliberate edit here — but it says
/// nothing about whether the wiring exists. Edit both sides and it stays green.
///
/// So this module adds a second, **derived** half. Whether a provider crate actually emits is read
/// out of that crate's own sources, in either of the two shapes candle families come in:
///
/// * a **shared-driver** family passes a preview hook where it could pass `None` to
///   `candle_gen::run_flow_sampler` / `run_curated_sampler` / `run_scm_sampler`;
/// * a **bespoke** family owns its denoise loop and emits by calling the shared preview module —
///   `PreviewHook::emit` / `PreviewHook::emit_step`, or the `emit_preview` / `emit_preview_at`
///   free functions underneath them.
///
/// Both shapes are declared per crate in `PROVIDER_CRATES` and checked against the sources, so a
/// crate cannot silently change shape and have its emission fact read as `no`. Neither fact can be
/// produced by editing an allowlist, so the two halves cannot be made to agree by editing one place.
///
/// The source-level scan follows the sc-16950 route inventory in `candle-gen-krea/src/preview.rs`,
/// widened from one crate and one driver to every registered crate, all three drivers, and the
/// bespoke emission calls.
///
/// ## What the scan reads, and what it deliberately does not
///
/// Only the crate's **shipped** module tree is scanned: the walk starts at `src/lib.rs` and follows
/// `mod` declarations, so an out-of-line `#[cfg(test)] mod NAME;` file (`candle-gen-krea`'s
/// `testfix.rs`, `candle-gen-z-image`'s four `*_validate.rs` GPU-validation modules, twenty-odd
/// others) is never read as shipped code. Reading them would be actively harmful in both
/// directions: a hooked call in an `#[ignore]`d validation file would demand a **false**
/// advertisement, and a `None` call in a test fixture would force a test file into a dark
/// declaration. Every `.rs` file under `src` must land in exactly one of those two buckets — an
/// unreachable file fails the scan rather than being silently skipped.
///
/// Test-only items are stripped from the shipped files first, by the *meaning* of their `cfg`
/// predicate rather than by its spelling: `#[cfg(test)]` and `#[cfg(all(test, …))]` are test-only
/// and go, while `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "testkit"))]` and `#[cfg(not(test))]` genuinely ship in
/// some configuration and stay.
///
/// ## The amendment protocol — read this before adding a family
///
/// This guard lands once, holding Krea alone, and is then **amended by each later family story in
/// that story's own PR**: sc-16952…sc-16960 each wire a family and, in the same PR,
///
/// 1. add its exact route ids to `PREVIEW_ROUTE_IDS`,
/// 2. flip its descriptors' `supports_preview`, and
/// 3. add that family's own **route inventory** — the per-file `hooked` / `direct` counts and the
///    pinned `DarkSite`s — to its `ProviderCrate` row, the way sc-16950 pinned Krea's.
///
/// Do not file a follow-up story for any of the three. The derived half is what makes (1) and (2)
/// self-enforcing: the moment a family's sources emit, its descriptors must advertise and the build
/// fails until they do. Step (3) is what keeps a **wired** family honest afterwards — without an
/// exact per-file count, blanking one route of an already-inventoried file changes nothing any
/// assertion can see.
///
/// ## Three classes, and a route is in exactly one (sc-16961)
///
/// A route that does not advertise previews is **not** thereby a rejected one, and the difference is
/// the difference between "someone should wire this" and "do not spend GPU time on this":
///
/// * `PREVIEW_ROUTE_IDS` — **wired**. Emits, and advertises `supports_preview: true`.
/// * `PREVIEW_INERT_ROUTE_IDS` — **no-go**, carried over from epic 16624 rather than re-measured. A
///   fit is a property of the VAE latent space, not of the backend, so a linear approximation that
///   misses the holdout bar on MLX misses it on candle too. **Do not re-run these fits**; the
///   `NoGo` basis on each row says whether it rides a measurement or a deliberate non-measurement.
/// * `PREVIEW_DEFERRED_ROUTE_IDS` — **viable but unwired**. Boogu's latent space already has a
///   committed fit clearing the bar (sc-17218 is the wiring).
///
/// `the_no_go_set_and_the_wired_set_partition_every_shipped_route` makes those three total over the
/// registered surface, so a newly registered route must be classified rather than defaulting into
/// silence, and the no-go set cannot go stale as the catalog grows. The full record —
/// numbers, per-family lineage, and the four VAE-relation shapes this epic observed — is
/// `docs/migration/evidence/sc-16961-preview-no-go-carry-over.md`.

    /// Krea (sc-16950), Qwen-Image (sc-16952) and Anima (sc-16953). The two Qwen-family entries are
    /// the two directions in which ids and render lanes fail to correspond, which is why neither may
    /// ever be inferred from the other:
    ///
    /// * **Qwen-Image contributes one row for three lanes.** The crate registers a single generator
    ///   descriptor (`qwen_image`); its edit and ControlNet/Fun lanes are bespoke providers the worker
    ///   drives by name, carrying a `preview` field on their own request types rather than a
    ///   descriptor, so there is no second id to advertise. The derived half still holds all three to
    ///   account: the route inventory on `candle-gen-qwen-image` below pins one hooked site per lane.
    /// * **Anima contributes three rows for one lane.** `anima_base`, `anima_aesthetic` and
    ///   `anima_turbo` are three registered descriptors over one architecture, differing only in the
    ///   DiT weights file, and they share a single `pipeline::AnimaPipeline::generate` body — so one
    ///   hooked sampler site wires all three at once, and the inventory below pins exactly one.
    ///
    /// The SDXL family (sc-16954) adds a third failure of correspondence, in a direction neither Qwen
    /// entry shows: **one id can cover lanes that are not all sampler sites**. `sdxl` and `kolors` are
    /// one descriptor each, but each registered route has *two* denoise lanes — a curated
    /// `run_curated_sampler` lane and a bespoke loop (SDXL Lightning; the Kolors native leading Euler)
    /// — and each crate additionally ships name-driven providers (SDXL edit / IP-Adapter, Kolors
    /// pose-control / IP-Adapter) that carry a `preview` field rather than a descriptor. The
    /// inventories below therefore mix `hooked` and `direct` counts in the same crate, which no
    /// earlier family needed.
    ///
    /// The FLUX.2 family (sc-16955) is the widest single unlock and adds a fourth failure of
    /// correspondence: **one latent space, three crates, two packing orders**. `flux2_klein_9b` /
    /// `flux2_dev` are one crate's two descriptors over three render lanes (txt2img plus the
    /// name-driven edit and strict-pose control providers, which carry a `preview` field rather than a
    /// descriptor); `lens` / `lens_turbo` reach the same 32-channel fit through `candle-gen-lens`,
    /// which owns no projector at all and re-exports `candle-gen-flux2`'s; and `ideogram_4` /
    /// `ideogram_4_turbo` share that fit while packing the 128 transformer channels in a different
    /// order, so they own the de-normalize/unpatchify half and reuse only the projection.
    ///
    /// Ideogram is also this table's first genuine `Denoise::Bespoke` **wired** crate: it drives no
    /// shared sampler anywhere, so it becomes visible below through a direct emission call rather than
    /// through a hooked call site. That is the case the direct-emission scanner was hardened for.
    ///
    /// `candle-gen-boogu` is deliberately absent, and its absence is a measurement rather than an
    /// omission: the epic groups it with FLUX.2, but it loads a plain 244-tensor **16-channel**
    /// `AutoencoderKL` (the FLUX.1 / Z-Image lineage, `z_image::vae::AutoEncoderKL`, SHA-256
    /// `8c717328…4c94`) with no `bn.*` stats at all, so the 32-channel fit does not describe its latent

    ///   in this crate's route inventory below, which pins one hooked site per file.
    /// * `candle-gen-pulid` registers **nothing at all** and is not even composed by
    ///   `register_providers`, yet it owns a `run_flow_sampler` site of its own. Before sc-16956 no
    ///   table in this module could see it: `PROVIDER_CRATES` is keyed on a registration function.
    ///
    /// Z-Image (sc-16957) contributes two rows — `z_image_turbo` and `z_image`, one crate, two
    /// descriptors — while wiring **nine** lanes across three files, and it adds two things no earlier
    /// family showed:
    ///
    /// * **Both wiring layers on the same registered pair.** `pipeline.rs` holds four hooked driver
    ///   sites (each descriptor's resident route plus its staged-residency twin, which a
    ///   `stage_residency` request reaches instead), while `control.rs` mixes two hooked sites with two
    ///   direct emissions: the *base* control lanes drive the shared sampler and the *distilled Turbo*
    ///   ones own bespoke Euler loops. The same crate is `Denoise::Shared` and emits directly, which is
    ///   why both counts appear on one file's row below.
    /// * **The `_control` route ids in this crate are memory strategies, not descriptors.**
    ///   `z_image_turbo_control` / `z_image_control` register a `MemoryRegistration` and nothing else,
    ///   so they have no id to advertise here — exactly the `candle-gen-flux` control/IP shape, and the
    ///   reason the two ids above cover nine lanes. `edit.rs`'s img2img provider is the same: a
    ///   name-driven worker stream carrying a `preview` field on its own request type.
    ///
    /// Z-Image also settles a question sc-16955 raised and sc-16956 half-answered. Its VAE is

    /// SANA (sc-16959) closes Tier 1 and contributes the two rows this table's "ids, not families"
    /// rule was written for. `sana_1600m` and `sana_sprint_1600m` are one crate, two registered
    /// descriptors, **two user-reachable lanes and two different shared sampler drivers** — the only
    /// candle family in this epic that drives more than one:
    ///
    /// * `sana_1600m` reaches `candle_gen::run_flow_sampler` through `pipeline::denoise_cfg`
    ///   (true-CFG flow-match Euler over a static shift-3.0 schedule, the whole curated epic-7114
    ///   sampler menu advertised, so `heun` / `dpmpp_sde` exercise the multi-eval dedup on that one
    ///   site);
    /// * `sana_sprint_1600m` reaches `candle_gen::run_scm_sampler` through `pipeline::denoise_sprint`
    ///   (CFG-free SCM / TrigFlow consistency, 1–4 steps, only the `"default"` sentinel advertised —
    ///   the SCM loop is not a curated `Solver` at all).
    ///
    /// They also carry **two different fits**, and that is what makes the two rows load-bearing rather
    /// than clerical. The two snapshots ship DC-AE autoencoders at an *identical* 1,249,044,836-byte
    /// container size whose SHA-256s differ — `15a4b09e…d9d87f` (base) against `dfd991d1…4454bb`
    /// (Sprint) — and each is byte-identical to the file the corresponding epic-16624 fit was measured
    /// on. A tensor walk says exactly how they relate, and the answer is a shape none of this epic's
    /// earlier stories showed: they **partially overlap**. 320 of 375 tensors are byte-identical,
    /// including the *entire* 179-tensor encoder, and all 55 that differ are in the `decoder.` subtree
    /// — Sprint's DC-AE 1.1 is a decoder-tail fine-tune of base's DC-AE 1.0. So this is **one latent
    /// space with two decoders**, and since an RGB preview fit maps a latent to *decoded* pixels, one
    /// fit still cannot serve both routes. Shipping one for both is the specific mistake sc-16959 was
    /// written to avoid; `candle-gen-sana/src/preview.rs` pins that three ways, and here
    /// `sana_base_and_sprint_are_two_independent_rows` pins that the crate hooks **both** shared
    /// drivers while `source_level_wiring_and_advertised_capability_agree_for_every_provider_crate`
    /// pins each of the two ids on its own.
    ///
    /// Sprint additionally needs a `1/σ_data` correction the flow cohort does not: `run_scm_sampler`
    /// pre-scales its running latent by `σ_data` and hands the hook the scaled tensor. That is the
    /// candle spelling of `mlx-gen-sana`'s `inverse_sigma_data` argument.
    ///
    /// SenseNova-U1 (sc-16960) closes the epic's **Tier 2** and contributes two rows —
    /// `sensenova_u1_8b` and `sensenova_u1_8b_fast`, one crate, two descriptors, one lane. It is the
    /// only family here that needed a fit of its own, and the reason is not the one the epic
    /// predicted:
    ///
    /// * **The epic's premise was wrong — SenseNova-U1 has no VAE at all.** It is a unified dual-path
    ///   Qwen3 MoT backbone whose flow-matching head predicts `3·(patch·merge)²` values per token,
    ///   which `unpatchify` folds straight back into `[1, 3, H, W]`. The model **denoises in pixel
    ///   space**: the running state of the loop *is* the image in `[-1, 1]`, and the "decode" is the
    ///   affine map `tensor_to_image` applies. So the measured fit is over **three** channels, which
    ///   on its own rules it out of every epic-16624 reuse (4, 16 and 32-channel VAE latents) with no
    ///   hash comparison needed. `tests/fit_preview_rgb.rs` measures it and
    ///   `the_snapshot_ships_no_autoencoder` proves the absence structurally — snapshot layout,
    ///   `config.json`, and the shard headers.
    /// * **It is the second genuine `Denoise::Bespoke` wired crate**, after Ideogram. A `git grep` of
    ///   the three shared drivers across `candle-gen-sensenova/src` returns nothing, and that is
    ///   deliberate rather than incidental: the descriptor advertises an **empty** sampler menu
    ///   because the AR backbone's per-step `KvCache` mutation makes any multi-eval curated solver
    ///   unsound. So its wiring becomes visible below through a direct emission call — one, in
    ///   `t2i.rs` — rather than through a hooked call site.
    /// * **It has a second denoise loop that stays dark on purpose.** `it2i_denoise` is the
    ///   off-registry understanding surface (VQA / Document-Studio interleave), reachable only
    ///   through `interleave_gen`, advertised by no descriptor, and known-corrupted on the edit path.
    ///   It is out of scope for sc-16960 and emits nothing, which is why the inventory below reads
    ///   `direct: 1` rather than `2`.
    ///
    /// `supports_preview` does **not** collapse to a single shipped boolean when this epic completes,
    /// and SenseNova is the permanent reason: it is candle-only, MLX never wired it, so at least one
    /// route stays engine-split for good. See `docs/migration/evidence/sc-16960-sensenova-candle-preview.md`.
