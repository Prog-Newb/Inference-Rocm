//! Which shared checkpoint rows each **registered Candle** provider id loads (sc-16667).
//!
//! # Disclosure only
//!
//! Everything here exists so a consumer can **show** a user which upstream artifacts a render
//! touched and what their licence texts name. Nothing in this module blocks, gates, degrades or
//! withholds anything, and nothing added here ever should — a mapping describes, it does not
//! decide. The nine registered ids that reach no shared row at all are a list of **gaps in the
//! data**, not a suppression list. That list lives in `tests` as
//! `IDS_WITHOUT_A_RESOLVABLE_COMPONENT` and is deliberately `#[cfg(test)]` rather than a public
//! const, so no gate can quietly use it to suppress the ids it names. Every one of them is
//! registered by [`provider_registry`](super::provider_registry), ships, and renders exactly as it
//! did before this module existed.
//!
//! # What this module is, and is not
//!
//! The [`ComponentLicense`](candle_gen::gen_core::ComponentLicense) rows themselves are
//! **backend-independent** and live once, in
//! [`MEDIA_COMPONENT_LICENSES`](candle_gen::gen_core::MEDIA_COMPONENT_LICENSES) — a licence is a
//! property of the checkpoint, and the MLX and Candle engines load the same checkpoints. Only the
//! provider-to-component mapping legitimately differs per backend, because the two catalogs register
//! different id sets. This module is the Candle half; `mlx-gen-catalog` carries the MLX half
//! (sc-16666). **No component row is duplicated here**, and none may be: a row added on one side
//! only would let the two catalogs answer differently about one upstream artifact.
//!
//! # How each list was derived
//!
//! From `docs/licensing/sc-16665-media-checkpoint-census.md`, which enumerates from the code — file
//! and line — every component each registered provider loads, cross-checked against what the
//! **Candle** crates themselves name. Where the two backends diverge, the Candle reading wins here;
//! the divergences are pinned by `per_backend_divergences_are_explicit` below rather than papered
//! over, per `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
//!
//! # Reusing a module is not provenance
//!
//! Three ids — `bernini`, `wan_vace`, `scail2_14b` — drive the **same two** `candle-gen-wan`
//! modules (`text_encoder::Umt5Encoder` at `TextEncoderConfig::umt5_xxl()`, `vae16::WanVae16` at
//! `Vae16Config::wan21()`) over a `text_encoder/` and a `vae/` under their own snapshot root. Only
//! the first two list `umt5_xxl` and `wan2_2_t2v_a14b`. That looks arbitrary and is not, so the
//! reason is written here rather than left to be re-litigated:
//!
//! * `bernini` — `candle-gen-bernini/src/convert.rs` states the snapshot it builds copies the stock
//!   Wan2.2 `text_encoder/`, `vae/` and `tokenizer/` **verbatim from a base Wan2.2-T2V-A14B
//!   diffusers snapshot**. The upstream is named by the code that puts the files there.
//! * `wan_vace` — `Wan-AI/Wan2.1-VACE-14B-diffusers` ships the transformer alone, so the encoder and
//!   VAE a VACE run reads can only have been staged from a stock Wan snapshot.
//! * `scail2_14b` — the loaded artifact is the converted `SceneWorks/scail2-mlx` re-host, which
//!   ships **its own bundled** `text_encoder/`, `vae/` and `clip/`. No source states where those
//!   copies came from; `candle-gen-scail2` names the architectures ("UMT5", "z16 Wan VAE") and
//!   stops, and the sc-16665 evidence pass recorded `google/umt5-xxl` and Wan2.1 as *unestablished
//!   candidates*. `scail2_umt5` and `scail2_wan2_1_vae` are therefore pinned holes, and the shared
//!   [`SCAIL_2`](candle_gen::gen_core::license::components::SCAIL_2) row says so in as many words.
//!
//! The rule the three cases share: a component is keyed at an upstream when **something states that
//! upstream** — the crate, the converter, or the repository's contents. Sharing a Rust module is a
//! fact about architecture. Keying SCAIL-2's bundled copies at the Wan rows on that basis is exactly
//! the "plausible-looking substitute row" this table exists to refuse.
//!
//! # Scope: the components a run **always** loads
//!
//! [`ProviderComponents`] carries a flat list with no
//! optionality, so a list has to mean one thing. It means: the artifacts every run of that id
//! loads. Two classes are therefore deliberately absent, and each is absent for a reason a reader
//! can check:
//!
//! * **Caller-selected add-ons** — the SDXL and FLUX IP-adapters, the Qwen-Image and
//!   Qwen-Image-Edit Lightning LoRAs, the Hyper-FLUX 8-step LoRA, the Anima official LoRAs, the
//!   Kolors ControlNet and IP-Adapter. A run may load none of them, so listing them would report
//!   obligations a given render never touched.
//! * **The non-registry overlays** — the PiD latent decoder, the face stack, depth, InstantID,
//!   SAM 3 and the bespoke Candle PuLID path: all six of
//!   [`BESPOKE_UTILITY_CRATES`](super::BESPOKE_UTILITY_CRATES). They register **no provider id at
//!   all** on this backend, so a provider-keyed table cannot
//!   express them; sc-16668 owns that surface. This is the widest gap in the module and it is
//!   deliberate: `nvidia/PiD` is an optional decode seam on fourteen Candle crates and no provider
//!   id distinguishes a run that used it from one that did not.
//!
//! A checkpoint that is **merged before the run** is *not* in either class and **is** listed:
//! `sensenova_u1_8b_fast` merges its distill LoRA and `ideogram_4_turbo` its bundled TurboTime LoRA
//! on every run, so both rows appear.
//!
//! # Incomplete lists are the honest state
//!
//! 46 checkpoints the media lane demonstrably loads have **no row** in the shared table, because
//! the sc-16665 evidence pass could not name the upstream, found nothing re-readable, or found two
//! primary sources disagreeing; they are pinned by `known_holes_stay_absent` in `gen-core`'s
//! component module. A provider that loads one of them simply has a shorter list. That is a
//! CI-visible hole, reported by sc-16669's gate — never a reason to withhold an id, and never
//! something to paper over by pointing at a plausible-looking substitute row.
//!
//! Nine registered ids reach **zero** resolvable components and therefore have no row here at all.
//! They register, load and render unchanged; what is missing is our metadata, and it is pinned by
//! `every_registered_id_is_mapped_or_a_named_hole`:
//!
//! | id(s) | why |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the six `mage_flow*` generators | every `microsoft/Mage-Flow*` repository 404s and the Qwen3-VL-4B tower bundled in each `text_encoder/` could not be named, so neither the DiT, the VAE nor the encoder has a row |
//! | `fancyfeast/llama-joycaption-beta-one-hf-llava` | one snapshot carries the whole captioner, and its only declaration is second-hand (`release/real-weight-models.toml`) |
//! | `clip_vit_l14`, `clip_vit_l14_text` | both read one `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14` snapshot, whose card declares nothing |
