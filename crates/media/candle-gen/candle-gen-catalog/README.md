# candle-gen-catalog

The **composition root** for the SceneWorks Candle media platform (shared by the CUDA and CPU
runtimes). Provider crates own their registrations; this crate owns only **selection and
stable ordering** — which families ship on Candle, and in what order they appear in the
registry. It does not own model implementations, duplicate descriptors, or infer membership by
scanning the workspace.

## Surface

```rust
use candle_gen_catalog::{provider_registry, register_providers, ProviderRegistry, ProviderRegistryBuilder};

// The complete, validated Candle media catalog:
let registry: ProviderRegistry = provider_registry()?;
let generator = registry.load("sdxl", &spec)?;

// Or add the whole platform to an existing builder:
let registry = register_providers(ProviderRegistryBuilder::new()).build()?;
```

- **`provider_registry()`** — build the complete explicit Candle catalog (51 generators, 7
  trainers, the JoyCaption captioner, and CLIP image/text embedders). The full list and the
  MLX/Candle deltas are in the [model catalog reference](../../../../docs/reference/model-catalog.md).
- **`register_providers(builder)`** — add every shipped Candle family to a builder, in stable
  order. This is the single reviewable source of truth for what ships: depending on a provider
  crate does **not** add it to the catalog; a family must be listed here explicitly.
- **`providers`** — re-exports every backend crate the platform owns (as `flux`, `krea`, …).
- **`BESPOKE_UTILITY_CRATES`** — the crates consumed through provider-specific APIs rather than
  the registry: `depth`, `face`, `instantid`, `pid`, `pulid`, `sam3`. (Note `pulid` is a
  bespoke utility here, whereas MLX ships it as the registered `pulid_flux` generator.)

`candle-gen` is re-exported as `media`, and `gen_core`'s `ProviderRegistry` /
`ProviderRegistryBuilder` are re-exported for convenience.

## Executable catalog contract

The crate's test pins the **complete, ordered id surface** for every provider kind, asserts
that every descriptor is on the `candle` backend, and runs the weights-free descriptor
conformance sweep. Changing the shipped surface requires an intentional update to that test —
that edit is the review point where platform inclusion becomes visible.

The `preview_advertising` test module (epic 16948, sc-16951) guards `Capabilities::supports_preview`
the same way, in both directions — but against the provider **sources** rather than against a second
hand-kept list. A crate that emits must advertise, and a descriptor that advertises must have wiring
behind it. Emission is read out of the crate's own **shipped** module tree in both shapes candle
families come in: a shared-driver family passes a preview hook to `run_flow_sampler` /
`run_curated_sampler` / `run_scm_sampler`, and a bespoke family (SenseNova, Ideogram) calls
`PreviewHook::emit` / `emit_step` or the `emit_preview` / `emit_preview_at` functions underneath.
Only the shipped tree is read — the walk starts at `src/lib.rs` and follows `mod` declarations, so an
out-of-line `#[cfg(test)] mod NAME;` file is never mistaken for shipped code.

**A story that wires a family amends that module in its own PR**, in three places:

1. add the family's exact route ids to `PREVIEW_ROUTE_IDS`,
2. flip its descriptors' `supports_preview`, and
3. add the family's **route inventory** to its `ProviderCrate` row — per-file `hooked` / `direct`
   counts and a `DarkSite` (driver + occurrence index + reason) for every site that deliberately
   passes `None`, the way sc-16950 pinned Krea's.

The build fails until all three happen. Steps 1 and 2 are enforced by the source-derived half; step 3
is what keeps a wired family honest afterwards — without exact per-file counts, blanking one route of
an already-inventoried file changes nothing any assertion can see. Weights-free, like the rest of the
contract.

Route ids and wired lanes are **not** one-to-one, and step 1 is about ids. `candle-gen-qwen-image`
(sc-16952) wires three render lanes — base txt2img, reference edit, and 2512-Fun ControlNet — but
registers one generator descriptor, because the latter two are bespoke providers the worker drives by
name and so carry a `preview` sink on their own request types instead of a descriptor. One id in
`PREVIEW_ROUTE_IDS`, three hooked sites in the route inventory; step 3 is what holds the two bespoke
lanes to account.

Consumers reach this catalog through the [`runtime-cuda`](../../../bundles/runtime-cuda/README.md)
and [`runtime-cpu`](../../../bundles/runtime-cpu/README.md) bundles, which validate it against
the Candle backend and pair it with the Candle LLM and snapshot-preparer catalogs.
