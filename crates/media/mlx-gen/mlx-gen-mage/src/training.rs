//! Rectified-flow **LoRA/LoKr training** on the Mage-Flow NR-MMDiT, Mac-first on MLX (sc-14055).
//!
//! The [`MageFlowTrainer`] realizes the backend-neutral [`Trainer`] contract on the **Base**
//! checkpoint (the confirmed training target, epic sc-14034): a frozen DiT + VAE encoder + Qwen3-VL
//! LM text encoder that caches a captioned image dataset to Mage-VAE latents / prompt embeddings,
//! then runs the functional-autograd LoRA loop and writes a PEFT adapter that reloads through the
//! inference path ([`crate::adapters::apply_mage_adapters`]).
//!
//! ## Reuse — the shared training core, with the Mage forward
//!
//! The host-generic factor machinery lives in [`mlx_gen::train::lora`] (build LoRA/LoKr targets,
//! inject them as forward-time residuals via
//! [`AdaptableLinear::set_adapters`](mlx_gen::adapters::AdaptableLinear::set_adapters), write the
//! PEFT safetensors), hoisted so every family trainer shares it. This module keeps only what is
//! Mage-specific: the native-resolution *packing* of a single training sample, the Mage-VAE encode
//! for latent prep, the Qwen3-VL gen-path conditioning, and the rectified flow-match noising.
//!
//! ## The rectified flow-matching objective and its sign — this is load-bearing
//!
//! Mage's sampler ([`crate::pipeline`]) starts from noise at scheduler sigma `σ = 1`, integrates
//! `x += (σ_next − σ_cur)·v` with `σ` decreasing to 0 (data), and the DiT `forward` returns the raw
//! velocity **without a negation**. For that Euler step to follow the flow-match ODE on the
//! interpolant `z_σ = (1−σ)·z + σ·ε` (data `z` at `σ = 0`, noise `ε` at `σ = 1`), the velocity the
//! model must predict is
//!
//! ```text
//! v = dz_σ/dσ = ε − z = noise − data.
//! ```
//!
//! So the training regression target is **`noise − data`**, and the loss is
//! `L = ‖ v_θ(z_σ, σ, τ) − (ε − z) ‖²`. The epic/story write the objective's velocity target as
//! `(z − ε)`; that is the opposite sign convention (the *forward*-time ODE velocity `−dz_σ/dσ`).
//! The value that matches Mage's **actual, parity-verified** sampler — `pipeline::flow_euler_step`
//! is `x + v·(σ_next − σ_cur)` and `MageTransformer::forward` does not negate — is `noise − data`,
//! which is exactly the regression target the z-image sibling trainer already uses (`noise − x0`).
//! A first-step check confirms it: at `σ = 1`, `x = ε`; one step to `σ' ≈ 0.947` gives
//! `ε + (σ' − 1)·(ε − z) = 0.947·ε + 0.053·z`, exactly `z_{σ'}`. Training toward `(z − ε)` would fit
//! the model to the negated velocity and corrupt generation.
//!
//! ## Timestep sampling distribution — the documented gap resolution
//!
//! Mage's **main-training** timestep sampling distribution is not published: the reference repo is
//! inference-only (no training code), and the paper states only that the VAE stage-I uses `U(0,1)`
//! (epic sc-14034 GAP 6, re-confirmed against the vendored source). Per the epic decision, this
//! trainer **defaults to the z-image trainer's schedule** — `sigmoid(randn)` with the same
//! `timestep_type` / `timestep_bias` knobs (the private `sample_sigma`) — and this choice is
//! recorded here, in
//! the PR, and on the story. The sampled `σ` is fed to the DiT directly (it is the scheduler sigma
//! where `σ = 1` is noise); the static schedule shift is a *sampling-time* schedule warp and is
//! **not** applied during training, matching the sibling.
