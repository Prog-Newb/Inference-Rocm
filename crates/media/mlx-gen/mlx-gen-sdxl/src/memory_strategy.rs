//! SDXL MLX adoption of the shared memory-strategy contract (SC-15449) — the ladder for the
//! **SDXL and derivatives** family (SC-15525), including its rung-4 half (SC-16355).
//!
//! ## One provider, five catalog entries
//!
//! `sdxl`, `realvisxl`, `realvisxl_lightning`, `illustrious_xl_v1` and `illustrious_xl_v2` are five
//! SceneWorks catalog entries with five separate `downloads` blocks and five weight repositories.
//! They are **not** five providers: `sceneworks-worker`'s `MODEL_TABLE` maps all five to
//! `engine_id: "sdxl"`, and this crate registers exactly one descriptor. So they share one contract
//! builder, one architecture, one `Residency` seam, one tiled decode, one bounded-attention
//! primitive and one block-residency stream — and each entry still owes its **own** per-tier
//! evidence. Sharing code is explicitly not what makes a catalog entry Verified.
//!
//! ## Declared rungs
//!
//! | Rung | Support | Executable seam |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 Resident | Implemented | Warm [`Residency`](mlx_gen::Residency) pair — dual CLIP + (U-Net + control/IP/VAE/PiD) held across requests |
//! | 1 Staged residency | Implemented (request-scoped) | `GenerationMemory::stage_residency` drives encode → **drop both CLIP encoders** → load heavy → denoise + decode |
//! | 2 Bounded decode | **Missing** (measured — [`DECODE_SUPPORT`]) | [`Autoencoder::decode_tiled`](crate::vae::Autoencoder) exists and bounds the decode 14.360 → 11.237 GiB, but no fixed tile edge holds its quality across the advertised output range |
//! | 3 Bounded attention | **Missing** (measured — [`ATTENTION_SUPPORT`]) | [`mlx_gen::attention::sdpa_budgeted_bhsd`] reaches every site, moves the peak **0.00% at BOTH scopes** (the request and the U-Net seam), and its query-row axis is not bit-exact on Metal |
//! | 4 Bounded transformer residency | Implemented (streamable loads) | [`mlx_gen::block_residency::run_windowed`] per `Transformer2D` — eleven sub-stacks, 70 blocks |
//!
//! ## What this family actually buys, measured (`realvisxl`, Apple/Metal, 1024², 6 steps)
//!
//! | composition | tier | request peak | vs baseline | ms/step | output |
//! |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
//! | resident | bf16 | 20.513 GiB | — | — | — |
//! | + rung 1 | bf16 | **19.003** | **−7.4%** | 780 | byte-identical |
//! | staged (control) | q8 | 17.693 | — | 740-913 | — |
//! | + rung 4, window 1 (default) | q8 | **15.516** | **−12.31%** | 3591-3790 | byte-identical |
//! | + rung 4, window 10 (selectable) | q8 | **15.516** | **−12.31%** | **1318-1325** | byte-identical |
//!
//! ## Rung 4's cost is time, and the CADENCE is the dial that sets it
//!
//! SC-16355 carried re-materialization latency as an explicit hazard — *"70 blocks across 11
//! re-opens could be a severe regression on exactly the small Macs this rung exists for"* — and it
//! was right. Nothing had measured it, and the first revision of this file published a single
//! cadence of 1 without ever comparing it: at 1024² it costs **+310%** wall clock for a saving every
//! other published cadence also achieves, and cadence 10 delivers the same −12.31% for **+51%**. The
//! default is now **10** for the reason on [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZE`] — the peak is flat wherever
//! the instrument can resolve it, so the cheap end costs nothing — and a selector that wants the
//! tightest weight bound can still choose 1, which it could not do while the domain had one value.
//!
//! The full sweep — peak, time and byte-identity per cadence, over three tiers and three output
//! sizes — is on [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZES`]. The short version is that the peak column is **flat**
//! at every measured configuration the instrument can resolve, and the mechanism is **phase
//! separation**: the peak is taken in the *decode*, not in the windowed forward, so cadence cannot
//! move it. The two cells that once looked non-flat (512² q8 and q4) were allocator noise indexed by
//! execution position — SC-17679 — which is why the default is the **widest** cadence: it costs no
//! memory and renders 2.7-4.4x faster.
//!
//! Latency is quoted as a range because it is a wall clock and moves with thermal state and machine
//! load (five runs of the window-1 row: 3591 / 3654 / 3674 / 3698 / 3790 ms/step, a ~5% spread). The
//! *peak* rows agree to the millibyte across every run, which is why the peak assertions in the sweep
//! are tight and the latency ones deliberately are not.
//!
//! None of this withholds the rung: on a host where the unwindowed composition does not fit, even
//! +310% is the difference between a render and no render
//! (`the_full_ladder_renders_under_a_memory_cap` runs the whole ladder under an 8 GiB cap). What it
//! changes is that a selector can now pick the cheap end of the frontier instead of the expensive
//! one — which it could not do while the domain had a single value.
//!
//! For contrast: the rung-2 geometry this family **withholds** would have bought −16.51% of the peak
//! for ~7% wall clock. Rung 4 at its default cadence buys −12.31% for +310%; at cadence 10, where a
//! selector may choose it, the same −12.31% costs +51%. Rung 2 would have been the better lever, and
//! it is withheld on quality rather than on cost.
//!
//! ## Per-entry coverage is NOT uniform — measured, per entry, per tier
//!
//! Both columns are per entry per tier, because SC-16355's AC is a **request peak measured per
//! tier** and a capability published per tier that is measured on one entry is the same substitution
//! this table exists to refuse. Every `Implemented` row below carries its own rung-4 row, taken at
//! the shipped default cadence against that same entry's staged control
//! (`every_catalog_entry_loads_and_publishes_the_ladder`, 1024², 4 steps):
//!
//! | entry | tier | staged peak | rung-4 peak (cadence 1) | rung 4 buys | rung 4 |
//! |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
//! | `sdxl` | bf16 | 19.005 GiB | 14.938 | **−21.40%** | Implemented |
//! | `realvisxl` | bf16 | 19.003 | 14.936 | **−21.40%** | Implemented |
//! | `realvisxl` | q4 | 16.654 | 15.493 | **−6.97%** | Implemented |
//! | `realvisxl` | q8 | 17.693 | 15.516 | **−12.31%** | Implemented |
//! | `realvisxl_lightning` | q4 | 16.654 | 15.493 | **−6.97%** | Implemented |
//! | `illustrious_xl_v1` | q8 | 17.693 | — | — | **Missing** |
//! | `illustrious_xl_v2` | q8 | 17.693 | — | — | **Missing** |
//!
//! **What rung 4 is worth is a function of the tier, and it is not small variation: −21.4% at bf16
//! against −7.0% at q4.** That is the phase-separation mechanism read off a second axis — the saving
//! is the whole `transformer_blocks` weight set (4.071 / 2.166 / 1.149 GiB by tier), so what changes
//! across tiers is the numerator while the resident remainder and the decode transient barely move.
//! A selector that sized rung 4's value off the q8 row would under-buy at bf16 by a factor of three.
//! See [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZES`] for the arithmetic.
//!
//! `realvisxl`/bf16 reads 19.003 GiB at **four** steps and also at six, because under rung 1 the
//! request peak is the phase envelope `max(CLIP-L + bigG, U-Net + VAE)` — a residency bound, not an
//! accumulation — so step count does not move it. Quoting the same figure for both is correct; what
//! would be wrong is quoting it without saying which row it came from.
//!
//! **Rung 4 is `Missing` on `illustrious_xl_v1`/q8 and `illustrious_xl_v2`/q8** — which is, today,
//! those two entries' only advertised tier, so it is `Missing` for those entries outright. The first
//! revision of this ladder's evidence did not say so, because its per-entry test recorded a peak and
//! never checked which ladder each entry published. It does now
//! (`every_catalog_entry_loads_and_publishes_the_ladder`, and the `EXPECTED_RUNG_FOUR` table beside
//! it).
//!
//! The cause is the **snapshot**, not the architecture. Both entries' `unet/` weights are genuinely
//! packed — u32 codes with `.scales`/`.biases`, 3.46 GiB, byte-for-byte the same shape as
//! `realvisxl`'s q8, and their measured 17.693 GiB peak is `realvisxl` q8's to the millibyte — but
//! their `unet/config.json` ships **without the `quantization` marker**. `mlx_gen::quant::packed_quant_bits`
//! reads that marker and only that marker, so [`load_leaves_blocks_lazy`] cannot distinguish this
//! load from one that would quantize at load time and materialize the trunk, and [`streamable`]
//! refuses. (The same missing marker also makes `warn_sequential_requantize` fire on every load of
//! these two — a visible symptom of the same root cause.)
//!
//! **The rung fails closed, which is correct, and the repair is a republished snapshot rather than a
//! looser predicate here** (tracked as sc-17522). Sniffing the tensors instead would put this
//! predicate and the F-144 requested-vs-packed tier guard on two different definitions of "packed",
//! and rung 4 replays the *recorded tier* into every re-materialized block — so the two must not be
//! allowed to disagree about what tier that is.
//!
//! **Two of the five rungs are `Missing`, and both verdicts are measurements rather than gaps.**
//! Their mechanisms are implemented, reach every advertised route, and are exercised by
//! `tests/memory_ladder_real_weights.rs`; what they failed is the bar, not the wiring. Recording
//! that with numbers is the point — a rung quietly omitted and a rung measured-and-rejected are very
//! different facts for a selector, and only one of them tells the next story where to look.
//!
//! ## Rung 1 is request-scoped, and what it does NOT release
//!
//! Before this story SDXL's residency was a load-time `OffloadPolicy` only. It is now request-scoped
//! through `stage_residency`: the same cached generator serves warm → staged → warm without
//! reconstruction, and the load-time policy survives only as the **default** for a request that
//! names nothing.
//!
//! Be precise about what the staged schedule buys, because it is two phases and not three. The seam
//! releases the **text encoders** before the heavy bundle loads, so the peak is bounded by
//! `max(CLIP-L + bigG, U-Net + VAE + overlays)` rather than the sum. It does **not** release the
//! U-Net before the decode: `SdxlHeavyOwned` is one bundle and the decode runs inside the same
//! render closure the denoise did. That is why rung 2 matters here more than on a family that can
//! shed its transformer first — SDXL's decode peak stacks on top of a resident U-Net.
//!
//! ## Rung 4: a plan per `Transformer2D`, not one per model
//!
//! SDXL is the first **U-Net** on this ladder; every prior MLX adopter is a DiT with one flat block
//! list. The windowable blocks live in eleven independent `Transformer2D` sub-stacks — six of depth
//! 10 (`down_blocks.2` ×2, `mid_block` ×1, `up_blocks.0` ×3) and five of depth 2 (`down_blocks.1`
//! ×2, `up_blocks.1` ×3), 70 blocks in total — so one U-Net forward drives `run_windowed` **eleven**
//! times, each against its own depth. See `crate::block_stream`.
//!
//! The conv/resnet trunk, the up/down samplers, each sub-stack's `norm`/`proj_in`/`proj_out`, and
//! the down→up skip stack are the **resident remainder**. The skip stack is the reason this rung's
//! *value* needed measuring rather than assuming: it holds down-path **activations** alive across
//! the whole forward, and rung 4 bounds **weights**, so the term it competes against does not
//! shrink. `docs/sc-16195/resolution-sweep.json` puts illustrious q8 at 4.74 GiB resident against a
//! 14.04 GiB transient — an activation-dominated profile, which is the opposite of the
//! weight-dominated DiTs where this rung has been worth 60-76%.
//!
//! ## Fail closed — the complete list
//!
//! Each of these is a typed rejection rather than a silently narrowed execution:
//!
//! * **any** bounded-decode selection (`refuse_decode`, and again in `decode_tiling`) and **any**
//!   bounded-attention selection (`attention_plan`) — rungs 2 and 3 are `Missing` here, and their
//!   mechanisms are still present in the crate as the sweep's subject, so the path from "the code
//!   exists" to "a render silently used it" is closed on both layers;
//! * a transformer window **component** this family does not implement (`TextEncoder` / `Both`) —
//!   never narrowed to `Dit`;
//! * a transformer window **size** outside [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZES`] (`validate_window`);
//! * rung 4 on a load that cannot stream — a single-file/LDM source, an eager load shape, a
//!   load-time quantization that materializes the trunk, or an **adapter load that merged**
//!   (see [`streamable`]);
//! * rung 4 without rung 1 engaged in the same request (declared as a prerequisite edge, so the
//!   shared selector enforces it).
//!
//! The decode and window checks are enforced on **two** layers on purpose: the admission gate
//! (`safety_check`) *and* the request-side resolvers. Every calibration and real-weight harness
//! reaches `generate` with a hand-built
//! [`GenerationMemory`](mlx_gen::gen_core::GenerationMemory) rather than through a validated
//! `MemorySelection`, which is precisely the path admission does not see.
//!
//! ## Ownership
//!
//! This file declares *structure and parameter domains only*. Measured coefficients, envelopes and
//! per-tier peaks live in SceneWorks generated evidence keyed by
//! [`MEMORY_CALIBRATION_FINGERPRINT`]; the worker owns live-budget accounting and least-cost
//! selection. The scope below is defense in depth: it can reject a selection, never substitute one.

/// 1. *It is not a ragged-split artifact.* Re-run at 1536², where 768 / 512 / 384 all divide the

/// 2. *It is not the blend loop.* `mlx_gen::vae_tiling` reconstructs a tile-consistent decode
///    exactly (`image_spatial_tiles_reconstruct`), and raising the overlap — which widens each
///    tile's context — moves 896 from 65 to 38, the direction a normalization-extent effect predicts
///    and a blending bug does not.
///
/// The mechanism is the **GroupNorms in the tail**: every `ResnetBlock2D` in `up_blocks` and the
/// final `conv_norm_out` computes statistics over the spatial extent it is handed, so a tile
/// normalizes against its own crop rather than the image.
///
/// ## Why 38/255 is nevertheless not publishable — the bar, and the range
///
/// **The bar is 48/255**, and it is inherited rather than invented: it is the worst drift a sibling
/// MLX provider on this same shared tiling machinery *admits* into a shipped ladder
/// (`mlx_gen_z_image::memory_strategy::DECODE_TILE_EDGES` tops out at 48 on its 768 px tile; its
/// rejected set starts at 64). Z-Image's decoder is the same diffusers `AutoencoderKL` with the same
/// spatial-extent GroupNorms and the same head/tail split, so it is the closest precedent that
/// exists. By that bar the 1024² sweep datum **passes**: 38 < 48, buying a measured
/// **19.0032 → 15.8660 GiB (−16.51%)** request peak at only ~7% wall clock (876 → 936 ms/step). On
/// the 1024² sweep alone this candidate should ship, and an earlier revision of this file was wrong
/// to claim otherwise — it asserted SDXL was "past that wall at every tile size", which its own
/// table above contradicts.
///
/// **Two independent measurements withhold it anyway**, and both were missing from that revision.
///
/// ### 1. On the latent a real render produces, 1024² does not clear the bar either
///
/// The 38/255 above is measured against a latent obtained by **re-encoding a finished image** — its
/// statistics have already been through the VAE round trip. Decode what the denoiser actually hands
/// the decode phase and the same geometry drifts **84/255**
/// (`the_withheld_decode_geometry_is_priced_at_the_request_level`). The production latent is the one
/// a user would get, so the one output size where the candidate looked admissible does not survive
/// contact with a production request. Nothing about the sweep was wrong — it is the right instrument
/// for comparing geometries against each other, and the wrong one for deciding an absolute bar.
///
/// ### 2. And the datum is a property of the geometry, not of the tile edge
///
/// `MemoryParameterRanges::decode_tile_edges` is an absolute pixel domain with no geometry axis, so
/// publishing 896 publishes it at everything `crate::model::descriptor` advertises — and that is
/// `max_size: 2048`. Re-swept across that range at the best overlap
/// (`no_single_decode_tile_edge_clears_the_bar_across_the_advertised_output_range`):
///
/// | output | tiles | tile covers | max Δ | vs the 48/255 bar |
/// |---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
/// | 1024² | 4 | 87.5% | **38** | clears (but see 1 — 84 on the production latent) |
/// | 1280² | 4 | 70.0% | 64 | fails |
/// | 1536² | 4 | 58.3% | 120 | fails |
/// | 2048² | 9 | 43.75% | 77 | fails |
///
/// The GroupNorm mechanism predicts exactly this shape: what governs the drift is the tile's
/// **fraction of the image**, because that is what sets how far a tile's statistics can sit from the
/// global ones. Edge 896 covers 87.5% of a 1024² output and 43.75% of a 2048² one. No fixed pixel
/// edge holds a constant fraction across a 4× range, so no fixed pixel edge is admissible across
/// this provider's advertised range — and a domain admissible at exactly one output size is not
/// something `decode_tile_edges` can express. A selector would size a fit off `[896]`, choose it at
/// 1536², and get either a hard admission rejection or a visibly seamed image.
///
/// So the rung is withheld — but the reason is now stated correctly and each half is asserted by a
/// test, and the prize is recorded with a number rather than dismissed: **−16.51% of the request
/// peak for ~7% wall clock**, which is a better memory/latency trade than rung 4's. What would
/// unlock it is a geometry-relative tile parameter (a fraction of the output rather than a pixel
/// edge), or a decoder whose tail normalizes over the full extent. Both are contract-level changes,

///
///    `gen_core::attention_budget` carries a **second** axis for exactly this reason:
///    `AttentionBudget::head_chunks` narrows complete heads and *preserves bit identity*, and its
///    docs say outright that the two axes "share a score budget, but not a numerical contract" and
///    must not be treated as interchangeable. `sdpa_budgeted_bhsd` never uses it. So the honest

///    This is a real reason to withhold *this* rung as implemented, and it is **not** a reason to

///
/// ### SC-17679: the 512² "non-flat" row was the instrument, not the family
///
/// Every row above was originally taken by a harness with **no warm-up of any kind**, which made the
/// cadence-1 row the first *windowed* row in its process. Re-measuring with a discarded row ahead of
/// every peak left five of the six rows byte-identical to what was published — and moved the 512² q8
/// row's values onto **different cadences** while keeping the same spread. That prompted three
/// controls, and together they settle it:
///
/// 1. **Execution-order permutation** (`SDXL_WINDOW_PROBE_ORDER`). Running the same four cadences
///    as `10,5,2,1` and as `2,10,1,5` produces the *same sequence of peaks in the same positions*:
///    `5.095, 5.384, 5.321, 5.384`, whichever cadence occupies each slot. The low value follows
///    **whichever cadence runs first after the warm-up** — cadence 10 when 10 runs first, cadence 2
///    when 2 runs first.
/// 2. **Identical-request repetition**
///    (`identical_requests_reproduce_once_the_allocator_has_settled`). Eight *byte-identical*
///    requests at 512² q8 read `5.3213 5.3214 5.0949 5.3839 5.3213 5.3838 5.3214 5.3838` — a
///    **5.67% spread with the input held constant**, wandering among the same three values and never
///    converging. At q8 1024² the same eight reads are `15.5155` **eight times, 0.00%**.
/// 3. **The negative control.** In the same runs, *wall clock* tracks the cadence and not the
///    position: cadence 1 costs ~2.9-3.0 s/step and cadence 10 ~0.67-0.69 s/step in **every**
///    execution order. So the instrument is perfectly capable of detecting a real cadence effect —
///    it detects one in latency, and none in peak.
///
/// **Conclusion: cadence has no measurable effect on the request peak anywhere in the advertised
/// range.** At every cell where the instrument resolves better than the differences being claimed
/// (1024² bf16/q8/q4, 768² q8, 512² bf16) all four cadences read the *same peak to the millibyte*,
/// order-independently. At the two cells where it does not (512² q8 and 512² q4, both ~5.7%
/// resolution) **no cadence claim is possible in either direction**, and the previously published
/// "5.7% non-monotonic spread" was allocator noise on unchanged input.
///
/// The 512² q8 row is therefore **withdrawn as evidence for anything**. It was the sole measured
/// objection to a wide default, and it was never evidence.
///
/// ### The condition, restated — and still unobserved
///
/// Flatness holds **only while** `decode transient + resident remainder` exceeds the windowed
/// forward's own peak at the *widest* published cadence. The decode transient scales with output
/// area; the windowed forward's peak scales with weights and is geometry-insensitive. So the
/// inequality must reverse as the output shrinks, and the first advertised geometry where it does
/// would be the boundary of the flat region.
///
/// **That boundary has not been observed anywhere in the advertised range.** The mechanism says the
/// hardest cell is the one with the largest weights at the smallest output — `bf16` at the
/// advertised `min_size`, where the forward's peak is biggest relative to the decode transient. That
/// cell is measured **flat at 0.00% resolution**: all four cadences read 4.7422 GiB. 512² q8 was
/// believed to be the boundary; it is an instrument artifact, and 512² q4 shows the same artifact
/// and was never in the published table at all.
///
/// The condition remains the right thing to check and remains checkable — it is simply not
/// satisfied-and-broken anywhere a user can currently reach. Publishing rung 2 is the change most
/// likely to break it (see below).
///
/// ### This is coupled to rung 2, and the coupling runs the wrong way
///
/// Every row above was measured with [`DECODE_SUPPORT`] `Missing`, i.e. with the decode transient at
/// **full size** — which is precisely the term keeping the forward off the peak. A story that ships a
/// bounded decode *lowers that term deliberately*, shrinking the flat region toward the small-output
/// end and potentially eliminating it. **"Widening the cadence is free" is not a property of this
/// family; it is a property of this family with rung 2 withheld.** Publishing rung 2 invalidates
/// every rung-4 row here and must re-measure the cadence domain in the same change — see
/// [`MEMORY_CALIBRATION_FINGERPRINT`], which must be bumped with it.

/// The transformer window rung 4 executes at when a request names none.

/// **The widest cadence — changed from the tightest by SC-17679, on measurement.**
///
/// The previous default of 1 rested on one measured claim: that "the peak is *not*
/// cadence-independent at 512² q8, where the spread is 5.7% and non-monotonic", so a default had to
/// be safe across a range where cadence demonstrably mattered. **That claim was an instrument
/// artifact and is withdrawn** — see [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZES`] for the three controls that
/// settled it (execution-order permutation, identical-request repetition, and the wall-clock
/// negative control). Cadence has no measurable effect on the request peak anywhere in the
/// advertised range.
///
/// What is left is a clean dominance argument:
///
/// * **Peak: identical.** At every cell where the instrument resolves better than the difference
///   being claimed — 1024² bf16/q8/q4, 768² q8, 512² bf16 — all four cadences read the same peak to
///   the millibyte, and re-running the sweep in a permuted execution order does not move it. At the
///   two cells that do not resolve (512² q8/q4, ~5.7% on unchanged input) nothing can be claimed in
///   either direction, so they support neither default.
/// * **Wall clock: 2.7-4.4× better, and genuinely cadence-borne.** Cadence 10 renders at ~0.67 s/step
///   against cadence 1's ~2.9-3.0 s/step at 512², and 1262 vs 3524 ms/step at 1024². Unlike the
///   peak, this tracks the *cadence* in every execution order — the same experiment that showed the
///   peak is positional showed the latency is not, which is what makes it trustworthy.
/// * **The mechanism's worst cell is measured flat.** Flatness should break first where the weights
///   are largest and the output smallest (`bf16` at the advertised `min_size`); that cell reads
///   4.7422 GiB at all four cadences, 0.00% resolution.
///
/// A default is what every caller who names nothing receives on every request. Shipping the tightest
/// cadence charged all of them a **3-4× slower render for a memory saving that does not exist**, and
/// rung 4's whole purpose is to make constrained hosts able to render at all — a rung that is
/// usable-but-slow is worth much less than one that is usable.
///
/// **The residual risk, stated so it is not rediscovered as a surprise.** The flat region is a
/// measured property of six configurations, not a proof. If some unmeasured cell *is*
/// cadence-dependent, this default under-delivers memory there, and that failure mode (a render that
/// does not fit) is harsher than the one it replaces (a slow render). Three things bound it: the
/// mechanism's hardest predicted cell is measured flat; the whole domain stays published and
/// selectable, so a caller that needs the tightest weight bound can ask for 1 explicitly against
/// calibration for that cadence; and this constant is coupled to rung 2 (below), whose publication
/// would invalidate the flat region and must re-measure the domain anyway.
///
/// This reverses the posture sc-17535 asked for in advance ("keep `TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZE` at the
/// tightest"). That instruction was given against the belief that the peak varied with cadence
/// somewhere in the range. It does not, and the reasoning is recorded here rather than silently
/// overridden — the standing "do not extrapolate from `realvisxl`" half of it still holds, and is

/// justifies the bump. (That draft left [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZE`] at **1**; v3 below moves it to

/// `v3` (SC-17679) because **the published default changed**, from the tightest cadence to the

/// by cadence — eight byte-identical requests span the same 5.67%. So v2 evidence records a
/// cadence-2 peak of 5.095 GiB for a cadence with no distinguishable peak at all. Either fact alone
/// justifies the bump.
///
/// **The paired evidence must be keyed per cadence, not per rung.** The cadences differ by up to 4.4×
/// in wall clock, so a selector weighing peak against time needs a row per candidate rather than one
