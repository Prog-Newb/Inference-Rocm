//! Ladder rung 4 — **bounded transformer residency** for the SDXL U-Net (SC-15525, closing SC-16355).
//!
//! The window lifecycle is NOT implemented here: it is
//! [`mlx_gen::block_residency::run_windowed`] (SC-15750), the shared primitive Z-Image, Anima, Qwen,
//! Mage-Flow and FLUX also drive. This module is only the family-side half — "how do I rebuild SDXL
//! sub-stack *S*'s block *n* from the snapshot, carrying the same tier and the same installed state
//! the resident block carries" — which is the part that genuinely differs per family.
//!
//! ## What makes SDXL different from every ladder shipped before it
//!
//! Every prior MLX rung-4 adopter is a **DiT with one flat block list**, so its stream is one object
//! addressing `blocks.{n}` and its plan is one [`BlockPlan`](mlx_gen::block_residency::BlockPlan).
//! SDXL is the first **U-Net**: the windowable blocks are 70 `TransformerBlock`s distributed across
//! **eleven** independent `Transformer2D` sub-stacks at two depths —
//!
//! | sub-stack | key prefix | count | depth |
//! |---|---|---:|---:|
//! | `down_blocks.1.attentions.{0,1}` | 2 | 2 | 2 |
//! | `down_blocks.2.attentions.{0,1}` | 2 | 2 | 10 |
//! | `mid_block.attentions.0` | 1 | 1 | 10 |
//! | `up_blocks.0.attentions.{0,1,2}` | 3 | 3 | 10 |
//! | `up_blocks.1.attentions.{0,1,2}` | 3 | 3 | 2 |
//!
//! — six 10-deep and **five** 2-deep. (SC-16355's description said "four 2-deep"; the up path has
//! `layers_per_block + 1 = 3` attentions, not 2, so it is five. `up_blocks.2` / `down_blocks.0` are
//! plain `UpBlock2D`/`DownBlock2D` and carry no attention at all, which is why the config's
//! `transformer_layers_per_block[0] = 1` is never read.)
//!
//! So there is **one stream per sub-stack**, each with its own prefix, its own depth and its own
//! plan, and one U-Net forward drives `run_windowed` eleven times rather than once. That is the
//! whole of SC-16355's "a per-`Transformer2D` block loader, not a per-model one".
//!
//! The conv/resnet trunk, the up/down samplers, the `norm`/`proj_in`/`proj_out` of each sub-stack,
//! and the down→up skip stack are the **resident remainder**: this rung does not bound them.
//!
//! ## Why re-reading per window is nearly free
//!
//! [`Weights::from_file`] goes through `Array::load_safetensors_with_metadata`, which is **lazy per
//! tensor**: the handles exist, the bytes do not, until something is evaluated. Re-opening the
//! U-Net's `diffusion_pytorch_model{,.fp16}.safetensors` once per window costs a JSON header parse,
//! not the tier. Only the tensors a window's blocks actually read are materialized, and
//! [`Weights::remove_accessed`] then drops the view's own reference to exactly those.
//!
//! `remove_accessed` is load-bearing rather than decorative: `Array` is refcounted, and
//! `TransformerBlock::from_weights` **clones** out of the view (it is the same constructor the
//! resident path uses). Draining after each block is what turns the window's drop into a real
//! release. The drain is *exact*, so a constructor read that never happened stays visible instead of
//! being wiped along with the rest.
//!
//! ## Replay: the two kinds of installed state, and the one that cannot be replayed
//!
//! A block rebuilt from the snapshot carries only what is *on disk*. Two things the resident block
//! holds are not:
//!
//! 1. **IP-Adapter decoupled K/V projections** (sc-3059). These are always forward-time installed
//!    state (`AttentionMHA::to_k_ip` / `to_v_ip`), so they are captured per block and re-installed
//!    verbatim. This matters more here than the count suggests: `install_ip_adapter` consumes one
//!    pair per cross-attention in **down → up → mid** order from a single iterator, so the mapping
//!    from pair index to block is positional and unreconstructable from a key path. Capturing the
//!    built `AdaptableLinear` off the resident block sidesteps re-deriving it entirely — and it is
//!    captured *after* `unet.quantize`, so a packed tier's IP projections replay packed.
//!    A streamed block that loses its pair would produce a **plausible wrong image** with no error,
//!    which is why `SdxlBlockStream::materialize` fails loudly instead
//!    (`ip_expected` / `has_ip`).
//! 2. **LoRA / LoKr adapters** — and these split. On a *packed* (pre-quantized Q4/Q8) snapshot
//!    `apply_sdxl_adapters_with` installs them as forward-time residuals (`AdaptableLinear::push`),
//!    which capture and replay exactly like Z-Image's. On a *dense* snapshot it calls
//!    `merge_dense_delta`, folding the delta into the base weight — and **that is gone from the
//!    snapshot**. There is no residual to capture, and a re-read block would silently be the
//!    un-adapted model.
//!
//!    This module therefore captures residuals when they exist, and `model::load_heavy` refuses to
//!    arm streaming at all for an adapter load that merged (see
//!    `memory_strategy::adapters_are_replayable`). Refusing is the only honest option: the
//!    alternative is a render that quietly drops the LoRA the user asked for.
