//! The per-route bounded-decode domain a PiD-eligible provider declares, and its enforcement
//! (SC-15775).
//!
//! [`selected_decode_tiling`](crate::engine::selected_decode_tiling) is a **shared,
//! provider-agnostic** seam: every PiD-eligible provider reaches it through
//! [`resolve_pid_decoder_at_sigma`](crate::engine::resolve_pid_decoder_at_sigma). SC-15510 taught it
//! to honour an explicit
//! [`GenerationMemory::decode_tile_edge`](mlx_gen::gen_core::GenerationMemory) so a shared-contract
//! bounded-decode ("rung 2") selection *executes* on the PiD route instead of being refused.
//!
//! That created a cross-provider hazard. Both routes measure "decode tile edge in output pixels", but
//! they are **disjoint domains**:
//!
//! | route | decoder | legal tile edges |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | native | the family's own VAE | its measured ladder, 256-768 output px in practice |
//! | `use_pid` | the super-resolving PiD student | [`budget::tile_edge_candidates`] — [`TILE_ALIGN`](budget::TILE_ALIGN) multiples from [`MIN_TILE_EDGE`](budget::MIN_TILE_EDGE) (1024) up to [`WATCHDOG_SAFE_EDGE`](budget::WATCHDOG_SAFE_EDGE) |
//!
//! The student decodes a `scale×` super-resolved output, so its tiles are necessarily larger than the
//! whole native output. The moment a second provider's memory-strategy adoption emits **its native VAE
//! ladder** into `decode_tile_edge`, a `use_pid` + rung-2 request on that provider flips from
//! "auto-plan, works" to a hard [`budget::validate_tile`] rejection at generate time. Qwen-Image is the
//! obvious next adopter (its probe ladder is 768/640/512/448/384/320/256) and it is PiD-eligible.
//!
//! The seam deliberately does **not** paper over it: silently falling back to the auto-plan when the
//! selected edge is not a legal PiD tile would execute a different strategy than the selector chose,
//! which is exactly what the shared contract forbids (SC-15449) and what made SC-15615 refuse rungs 2+
//! on PiD in the first place. So an out-of-domain edge has to be loud.
//!
//! ## What this module does about it
//!
//! It moves the obligation from a doc comment ("copy Z-Image's shape") into an API that makes the
//! mistake hard to write and impossible to ship quietly, in four layers:
//!
//! 1. **[`DecodeRoutes::new`] is a *checked* constructor, and the only one.** It takes the *native*
//!    ladder only — the PiD ladder is an associated function, not a constructor argument, so a
//!    provider **cannot supply a PiD-route domain at all**. On top of that it returns [`Result`]: a
//!    native ladder that reaches into the PiD student's tile domain, or is otherwise degenerate,
//!    **does not construct**. So a `DecodeRoutes` value in hand is proof its two routes are disjoint,
//!    and that holds in release builds and for an adopter with no tests of its own.
//!
//!    Stated precisely, because the looser claim was made once and was wrong: an illegal
//!    *declaration* — a `DecodeRoutes` whose routes overlap — is unrepresentable. The *inputs* to an
//!    illegal declaration are of course still writable; what is impossible is getting a value back
//!    from them.
//! 2. **[`assert_decode_routes`] is the weights-free test-suite form** a provider runs beside
//!    `gen_core_testkit::memory_strategy_conformance`. Same predicate as the constructor, so it adds
//!    no second definition of "conforming"; what it adds is *when* the failure lands — a provider that
//!    declares its ladder in a `const` gets a named CI failure instead of a load-time error.
//! 3. **The seam itself asserts** (see [`selected_decode_tiling`](crate::engine::selected_decode_tiling)).
//!    A provider that bypasses this module entirely still trips a `debug_assert` the moment any test
//!    drives a native geometry into a `use_pid` request, so the mis-wiring lands in CI rather than in
//!    a user's generate call. Release behaviour is unchanged: [`budget::validate_tile`] still rejects,
//!    typed, and still never re-plans.
//! 4. **The workspace gate refuses a provider that never reaches for any of the above.** Layers 1-3
//!    help a provider that *calls* them, and layer 3 only fires if some test drives the request — so
//!    `scripts/check-workspace.py`'s `check_pid_decode_route_adoption` fails any workspace member that
//!    depends on this crate, registers a memory-strategy contract, and shows any sign of implementing
//!    rung 2, unless its sources actually **call** the checked constructor and **call**
//!    [`DecodeRoutes::validate`]. It matches on comment-stripped source, so a `// TODO: use
//!    DecodeRoutes` or an unused `use` satisfies nothing. That is what makes the obligation
//!    **automatic** for the next adopter instead of opt-in: it is keyed on facts about the crate, not
//!    on a list of crate names anyone has to remember to extend.
//!
//! [`DecodeRoutes::validate`] is the admission gate itself — the route-aware check a provider's
//! `safety_check` and request scope call, replacing a hand-rolled per-provider `match`.
