//! SC-15754 — DiT-level bounded transformer residency (ladder rung 4) on the MLX Z-Image DiT.
//!
//! Weight-free: reuses the tiny synthetic fixtures the parity tests already ship
//! (`z_transformer.safetensors`, `z_control_transformer.safetensors`) copied to a temp file, so this
//! runs in ordinary CI rather than only on a Mac with a 35 GB snapshot. The *memory* half is
//! necessarily a real-weights measurement and lives in `block_residency_real_weights.rs`; what runs
//! here is the half that can silently rot without anyone noticing — **correctness**.
//!
//! ## Why "windowed == resident" alone would be a false green
//!
//! SC-15750 built the primitive with a mutation check because its failure mode is silent: drop a
//! window before forcing evaluation and you free nothing while still producing correct images. The
//! family integration has a *mirror-image* silent failure — run the resident blocks and never touch
//! the stream at all. Output is identical, no error, no saving. An equivalence assertion is green in
//! both the working and the deleted implementation.
//!
//! So the equivalence tests here are paired with a **source mutation**: after the model is built, the
//! `.safetensors` on disk is rewritten with perturbed `layers.*` weights. A windowed forward re-reads
//! its blocks from that file, so its output must CHANGE; the resident forward holds the originals in
//! memory, so its output must NOT. A windowed path that quietly used `self.layers` fails both halves.
//!
//! That also pins the **captured adapters**, which are what make a streamed block a faithful twin
//! rather than an approximation on an adapted load — with a mutation arm that skips the capture and
//! requires the outputs to diverge.
//!
//! The other half of that fidelity, the per-block **quantization replay**, is deliberately NOT here:
//! the whole-transformer `quantize()` also touches the timestep embedder, whose fixture in-features
//! are not group-64 divisible, so a DiT-level test would either fail or silently stay dense. It lives
//! where the mechanism does — `block_stream::tests::a_materialized_block_replays_the_recorded_quantization`
//! compares a streamed block's packed codes/scales/biases against a resident block quantized the same
//! way. (Nothing reached it before: the real-weights suite runs against a pre-quantized tier dir,
//! where `quantize()` is a documented no-op.)
