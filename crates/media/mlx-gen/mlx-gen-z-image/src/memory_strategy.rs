//! Z-Image MLX adoption of the shared memory-strategy contract (SC-15449) — the **complete** ladder:
//! rung 3 (bounded attention, SC-15615), rung 4 (bounded transformer residency, SC-15754), and the
//! widened rung-2 decode domain plus the PiD reconciliation (SC-15510).
//!
//! All four registered Z-Image variants — `z_image_turbo`, `z_image`, `z_image_turbo_control`,
//! `z_image_control` — share one DiT, one staged [`Residency`](mlx_gen::Residency) seam, one tiled VAE
//! decode, one bounded-attention primitive and one block-residency stream, so they share one contract
//! builder. Only the provider id and the advertised request surface differ.
//!
//! **`z_image_edit` is a catalog id, not a provider.** It is served by `z_image_turbo` (edit mode over
//! Turbo weights), so it inherits this contract rather than declaring one — there is no fifth provider
//! here and no alias mechanism in this crate. The resolution lives on the SceneWorks side, in two
//! places, and both are pinned there rather than asserted here:
//! `jobs_store::routing::mlx` maps `z_image_turbo | z_image_edit` to the same eligibility and engine,
//! and the matrix generator's `backendScopes` inherits the entry's advertised backends from
//! `z_image_turbo` (`z_image_edit inherits its backend scopes from the z_image_turbo provider`).
//! Consequently `MemoryMode::Edit` must be admissible on this contract — see
//! `the_edit_surface_z_image_edit_resolves_to_is_admissible`.
//!
//! ## Declared rungs
//!
//! | Rung | Support | Executable seam |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 Resident | Implemented | Request-scoped `Residency` warm pair — encoder + DiT + VAE held across requests |
//! | 1 Staged residency | Implemented (request-scoped) | `GenerationMemory::stage_residency` drives encode → drop encoder → denoise → **drop DiT** → decode |
//! | 2 Bounded decode | Implemented | `Vae::decode_tiled` over the [`DECODE_TILE_EDGES`] ladder, or the PiD student over [`pid_decode_tile_edges`] (`pipeline::decode_tiling`) |
//! | 3 Bounded attention | Implemented | [`mlx_gen::attention::sdpa_budgeted_bhsd`] threaded through every DiT attention (SC-15615) |
//! | 4 Bounded transformer residency | Implemented (snapshot loads) | [`mlx_gen::block_residency::run_windowed`] over the 30 unified blocks, and the 15 ControlNet blocks (SC-15754) |
//!
//! Rung 4 is available only for a snapshot load that explicitly requests
//! [`LoadShape::DeferredMaterialization`](mlx_gen::LoadShape). The two facts are independent:
//! `WeightsSource::Dir` supplies a re-openable source, while the load shape says not to bulk-commit
//! the resident transformer stacks. Phase-level release remains a separate request-scoped axis.
//!
//! **This is the MLX column, and it is not the Candle column.** As of SC-15754 the MLX lane carries
//! all five rungs; `candle-gen-z-image` carries 0-3 and has no rung 4. Neither the presence nor the
//! *magnitude* of a rung transfers between the two backends — rung 3 exists on both and is worth far
//! more on Candle (see below), and rung 4 exists only here. Every per-backend saving in this file was
//! measured on this backend.
//!
//! **Compare rung-3 magnitudes like-for-like.** An earlier revision of this note said rung 3 is worth
//! "~6×" more on Candle. That was a scope error corrected in SC-15793: Candle's −32% is a **denoise-
//! phase** delta while MLX's −5.0% is a **whole-request** one. On the denoise phase MLX measures
//! **−1.7%**, so like-for-like the gap is −32% vs −1.7% — roughly an order of magnitude, not ~6×
//! (and the two figures are published in different units, GB vs GiB). This file is calibration-facing,
//! so the scope of every quoted number matters: see `gen_core::attention_budget` for the full table.
//!
//! **Rung 1 is request-scoped (SC-15806).** `z_image_generation_memory` sets
//! [`mlx_gen::gen_core::GenerationMemory::stage_residency`] only when the contract says rung 1 is
//! engaged. The same
//! cached generator can therefore serve warm → staged → warm without reconstruction. Z-Image ignores
//! the legacy load-time [`OffloadPolicy`](mlx_gen::OffloadPolicy); the shared contract selection is
//! the authority.
//!
//! **Rung 4 does not depend on rung 1.** A window needs a deferred-materialization load, which can be
//! composed with either `Resident` or `Sequential` phase residency. An eager load rejects the window
//! because it would add a second block copy on top of the materialized trunk.
//!
//! ## What each rung is worth here (measured, Apple M5 Max, real `z_image_turbo`, 1024², 4 steps,
//! staged residency, count 1 — `tests/block_residency_real_weights.rs`)
//!
//! Staged **denoise** peak, every hosted tier:
//!
//! | tier | rungs 1-3 (the SC-15615 top) | + rung 4 | cut | request peak | bound by |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
//! | q4 | 4.653 | **1.795** | **−61%** | 4.363 GiB | decode |
//! | q8 | 7.486 | **2.149** | **−71%** | 5.087 GiB | conditioning |
//! | bf16 | 13.362 | **3.201** | **−76%** | 8.489 GiB | decode |
//!
//! The saving scales with the tier's weight size — which is what a *weights*-bounding rung should do,
//! and exactly what distinguishes it from rung 3, whose saving is activation-side and
//! tier-independent (0.245 GiB on q4, an order of magnitude smaller).
//!
//! **On a memory-constrained host** ([`mlx_gen::memory::apply_memory_cap_env`]) the bound holds and
//! re-materialization does **not** get materially more expensive, which is the question SC-15754 asked
//! before choosing a production window: q4 under a 4 GiB MLX cap costs 2.918 s/step resident against
//! 3.191 windowed (+9%, against +4-8% unconstrained), and q8 under a 6 GiB cap lands at a 4.768 GiB
//! request peak.
//!
//! **Both q4 and q8 fit an 8 GiB budget** on both host classes (4.363 / 5.087 GiB unconstrained,
//! 4.363 / 4.768 constrained, against 6.0 GiB usable after the generic gate's 2 GiB reserve). q8 was
//! SC-15615's open question — it concluded only rung 4 could move it, and predicted the binding phase
//! would become the Qwen text encoder. Both hold. **Disclosure:** measured on a 128 GB machine with
//! MLX's ACTIVE-bytes counter, not on a physical 8 GB Mac whose unified pool is shared with
//! macOS/WindowServer/SceneWorks — what decides that render is SC-15611's admission arithmetic and
//! SC-15614's reserve.
//!
//! **Rung 4 cuts the denoise phase by 61%** — 2.86 GiB, an order of magnitude more than rung 3's
//! measured 0.245 GiB on this lane — and in doing so it **moves the binding phase off the denoise**.
//! The q4 request peak is now the *decode* (4.363 GiB), which is why SC-15510's other half, the
//! widened [`DECODE_TILE_EDGES`] ladder, is the lever that matters next. Rung 3's small saving is not
//! a defect: MLX's fused SDPA never materializes the `[B,H,Sq,Sk]` score tensor that Candle's
//! `attention_basic` does, so the same knob buys a lazy-graph cut here and a bounded score matrix
//! there (SC-15615 pins the mechanism with an inert never-chunks control).
//!
//! **The window size is inert here, and that is a measurement.** Windows 15, 8, 4 and 2 all land on
//! 1.832 GiB, and so does a window of **30** — one all-covering window that bounds nothing. The
//! family's block loop materializes one block, runs it and drops it before advancing, and that drop is
//! a real release because rung 3's per-chunk `eval` already evaluated the carried activation inside
//! the block's own attention. So residency is per-BLOCK by construction, and
//! [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_SIZES`] publishes the single exact value instead of four rows that differ only
//! by noise.
//!
//! ## Route coverage
//!
//! Rungs 3 and 4 reach **every** advertised denoise route — plain t2i, base CFG (both the cond and the
//! uncond forward), turbo control and base control (including the ControlNet branch's own 15 blocks),
//! and the PiD route, whose denoise is the ordinary DiT.
//!
//! **The PiD route is now a first-class rung-2+ route** (SC-15510). SC-15615 had to refuse rungs 2 and
//! above with the overlay, because the super-resolving student planned its own tile edge/overlap from
//! `mlx_gen_pid::budget` and never read the contract's parameters — admitting a selection would have
//! executed a different strategy than the selector chose, and the cumulative ladder dragged rung 3 down
//! with it. `mint_planned_decoder_with_tiling` now honours an explicit plan and validates it against
//! the planner's own invariants, so the overlay has a real, published candidate domain.
//!
//! That domain is **not the native one**. Both are "decode tile edge in output pixels", but the native
//! VAE tiles a 1024²-class output at 512-768 px while the student tiles a `scale×` super-resolved
//! output at its own, much larger edge (2048 px — see [`pid_decode_tile_edges`]), so the two sets are
//! disjoint. The static contract publishes their union —
//! it is the provider's whole production domain, and `validate_selection` is not route-aware — while
//! `safety_check` and the request scope, which both see `use_pid`, enforce the route's own subset. A
//! selection built for one route is rejected on the other rather than silently re-planned.
//!
//! Both the split and its disjointness are the shared [`mlx_gen_pid::DecodeRoutes`]' (SC-15775), not
//! this file's: this module's `decode_routes()` declares only the native ladder, the PiD half comes
//! from the student, and
//! [`DecodeRoutes::new`](mlx_gen_pid::DecodeRoutes::new) **refuses to construct** a native ladder that
//! reaches into the PiD domain, so this file cannot publish one. The
//! obligation used to be a doc comment on `mlx_gen_pid::engine::selected_decode_tiling` telling the
//! next adopter to copy this file's shape; it is now an API that the next adopter cannot get wrong
//! quietly.
//!
//! ## Ownership
//!
//! This file declares *structure and parameter domains only*. Measured coefficients, envelopes, and
//! per-tier peaks live in SceneWorks generated evidence keyed by
//! [`MEMORY_CALIBRATION_FINGERPRINT`]; the worker owns live-budget accounting and least-cost
//! selection. The scope below is defense in depth: it can reject a selection, never substitute one.

/// rung's name transfers its magnitude between backends; what transfers is the mechanism, and the
/// numbers have to be re-measured on the decoder that will run them. Swept against the **exact
/// untiled decode** on real q4 weights at 1024² (`tests/block_residency_real_weights.rs`):
///
/// | tile | decode peak | max Δ vs exact | mean Δ |
/// |---:|---:|---:|---:|
/// | untiled | 19.422 GiB | — | — |
/// | 768 | 8.089 | 48 | 2.82 |

/// | 320 | 4.051 | 74 | 3.05 |
/// | 256 | 3.157 | 83 | 3.34 |
///
/// Two things fall out, and both are why the ladder stops at 512:
///
/// 1. **Below 512 the image measurably degrades** — max Δ jumps 46 → 64 → 83 and mean Δ rises
///    monotonically. That is the sc-13571 comment ("smaller tiles would drift the per-tile norm
///    statistics") confirmed by measurement on this GroupNorm VAE. `GenerationMemory`'s levers are
///    documented as *quality-preserving*; a tile that visibly seams is a quality trade, not a rung.
/// 2. **And it buys nothing at the request level.** Every sub-512 tile leaves the request peak at
///    4.898 GiB, because the denoise phase binds there — and the decode peak is not even monotone
///    (4.645 at 448 is *worse* than 4.363 at 512). Paying image quality for no admission win is a
///    strictly bad trade.
///
/// The separation is clean rather than marginal: the admitted set tops out at 48/255 and the rejected
/// set starts at 64/255, a 33% gap, which is what the sweep's bound is set from.
///
/// 640 and 768 cost *more* decode memory than the default and are published anyway, because the
/// ladder is a **domain**, not a recommendation: at a larger output a 512 px tile is many more
/// forwards, and the selector — not this file — owns the peak-vs-latency choice. Selection is the
/// worker's; this is the set it may choose from.
///
/// Why widening mattered at all: decode is **tier-independent** — measured 4.363 GiB (q4) and
/// 4.364 GiB (q8) at 1024², because after `shed_dit` only the ~150 MB VAE remains and the rest is the

/// setting — which means the peak is not set by the window at all.
///
/// The reason is structural, and it is in this family's block loop rather than in the primitive:
/// [`ZImageTransformer::run_windowed_layers_with_hints`](crate::ZImageTransformer) materializes ONE
/// block, runs it, and drops it before advancing, so at most one block is ever held. The drop is a

/// select it.
///
/// A window is an **upper bound** on residency, so holding fewer blocks conforms — but the number the
/// contract publishes is what a caller uses to *predict peak*, and declaring 8 while holding 1 would
/// over-predict and make the selector reject fits it could have taken. Declaring `[1]` is the exact,
/// measured truth.
///
/// Advertising the four indistinguishable values would also have been the epic's own failure mode one
/// level down: a calibration sweep would have recorded four rows differing only by noise, and a
/// selector would have "chosen" between them meaninglessly.
///
/// The sweep did find a real ~5% *latency* effect — batching several blocks per snapshot re-open is
/// cheaper than re-opening per block (2.967 s/step at 4, 3.111 at 1). **It is deliberately not taken.**
/// Executing at a wider cadence while declaring 1 would raise the true peak to 1.832 GiB against a
/// declared 1.795, i.e. the contract would **under-predict by 37 MiB** — the one direction that
/// matters, because the caller uses the declared window to decide whether a request fits. Five percent
/// of the denoise phase on the rung reached only under memory pressure is the right thing to spend to

///
