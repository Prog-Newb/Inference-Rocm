//! Re-derive `preview::RGB_FACTORS` / `RGB_BIAS` — the producer for the linear latent→RGB fit.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `preview.rs` carries the fit as source constants and tells a future maintainer to **"refit
//! whenever the VAE lineage changes, by dumping the two halves of a real render and re-solving."**
//! Until this file, that instruction named a procedure with no implementation: nothing in the tree
//! rendered the pairs, and nothing solved the system. The constants were therefore unreproducible —
//! not merely un-re-run, but *un-checkable*, since a reviewer had no way to ask whether R² = 0.9586
//! was right.
//!
//! That is the same defect class as the single-host parity goldens (issue #311), and worse in one
//! respect: a golden is a gitignored test input, while these are shipping constants in `src/`.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Renders the fit corpus, then solves `decoded_rgb ≈ latent · M + b` by ordinary least squares:
//!
//! 1. render each (prompt, seed) at 1024², 8-step Lightning;
//! 2. take the **final unpacked latent** `[1, 16, 128, 128]` — the same tensor `preview::project`
//!    sees, so the fit is over exactly the input it will be applied to;
//! 3. decode it, denormalize to `[0, 1]` the way [`decoded_to_image`] does, and **8×-average-pool**
//!    to latent resolution, giving one RGB target per latent position;
//! 4. accumulate the normal equations over every position of every render and solve.
//!
//! # It reports rather than asserts agreement
//!
//! The committed constants were fit from a corpus that no longer exists, so this cannot claim to
//! reproduce them: a re-solve here is a *different sample* of the same VAE, not a replay. Asserting
//! equality would fail on sampling noise and mean nothing when it passed. So the test asserts the
//! property that is actually invariant — the fit explains most of the variance ([`R2_FLOOR`]) — and
//! **prints** both the new constants and their delta against the committed ones for a human to read.
//!
//! A large delta is a finding, not a failure: it means the committed fit does not describe this VAE
//! at this configuration, and the printed block is what should replace it.
//!
//! # sc-17515: the first execution measured R² = 0.0114, and the fit was never the problem
//!
//! sc-17284 gave this file its first run anywhere and it failed its own floor by two orders of
//! magnitude, with a re-solved intercept identical in all three channels to four decimals. Two
//! causes were proposed — a degenerate corpus, or a moved VAE lineage — and **neither held**. The
//! defect was in this file, on the two lines that read the samples back to the host:
//!
//! `mlx-rs` `as_slice` returns the array's **physical buffer, ignoring strides**, so a
//! `transpose_axes`-terminated array reads back in its *pre-transpose* order. Both host reads below
//! ended in a transpose. Sample *i* therefore paired 16 consecutive values of latent channel 0 with
//! 3 consecutive pixels of the red channel — unrelated quantities, hence R² ≈ 0, and three targets
//! drawn from one channel, hence the three identical intercepts. The flattening `reshape` that fixes
//! it is the same one `mlx-gen-z-image`'s sibling producer already carried; of the seven MLX
//! producers this was the only one that read a transpose-terminated array without it.
//!
//! Measured on nax-macos against `SceneWorks/qwen-image-mlx@8080a417` bf16, 32768 samples. These are
//! the **unclamped** re-solve R², the quantity [`R2_FLOOR`] gates:
//!
//! | corpus | physical read (the bug) | logical read (fixed) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | no LoRA, as this file shipped | 0.0114 | 0.9766 |
//! | + 8-step Lightning LoRA | 0.0027 | 0.9521 |
//!
//! Applying the LoRA made the *broken* number worse, not better, which is what eliminated the
//! degenerate-corpus theory outright; the renders were coherent photographs either way (std 48–77,
//! 246–256 distinct levels). And the **committed** constants, scored unchanged on that corpus, come
//! back at R² = 0.9450 — so the VAE has not moved out from under them either, and they were left
//! alone.
//!
//! **Two scorings, and the difference is not noise.** The committed score clamps, because
//! `project_latents` clamps before the 8-bit round and the honest question is what gets *drawn*; the
//! floor's re-solve score does not, because that one is asking whether a linear map fits at all.
//! Clamping only ever moves a prediction toward the valid range the targets live in, so it raises
//! R²: the same re-solve that scores 0.9521 unclamped scores **0.9633 clamped, mean |ΔRGB|
//! 10.01/255**. That is the like-for-like counterpart of the committed 0.9450 / 12.58, and the two
//! must never be quoted against each other. `fit_preview_rgb_factors` therefore computes both in one
//! pass and prints them adjacently — before that, the 0.9633 in this file's and `preview.rs`'s doc
//! comments was unreproducible from the committed code and read as contradicting the table above.
//! The `RGB_FACTORS` note in `src/preview.rs` carries the same figures.
//!
//! # The corpus applies the Lightning LoRA
//!
//! Both this file and `preview.rs` describe the fit as "8-step Lightning", but the corpus used to
//! take only [`lightning_sigmas`] — the distilled *schedule* without the distillation *adapter*.
//! That is not what the constants document, and it is measurable: without the LoRA the re-solve
//! lands 0.26 from the committed factors, with it 0.082. Since both clear the floor, this is a
//! fidelity fix rather than a way to go green.
