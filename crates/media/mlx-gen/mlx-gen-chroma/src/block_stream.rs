//! Ladder rung 4 — **bounded transformer residency** for the Chroma1 MMDiT (SC-15520).
//!
//! The window lifecycle is NOT implemented here: it is
//! [`mlx_gen::block_residency::run_windowed`] (SC-15750), the shared primitive Z-Image, Qwen,
//! FLUX.1, Anima and Kolors also drive. This module is only the family-side half — "how do I rebuild
//! Chroma block *n* from the snapshot, carrying the same tier and the same adapters the resident
//! block carries" — which is the part that genuinely differs per family.
//!
//! ## Two sub-stacks, one cadence
//!
//! Chroma inherits FLUX's split trunk: 19 `transformer_blocks` (double / joint stream) followed by
//! 38 `single_transformer_blocks`. They are windowed **independently** over the same cadence,
//! because the carried activation changes shape between them (`(encoder, hidden)` before the
//! concatenation, one `joint` tensor after it) and a single plan cannot span both.
//!
//! ## Why re-reading per window is nearly free
//!
//! [`Weights::from_dir`] goes through `Array::load_safetensors_with_metadata`, which is **lazy per
//! tensor**: the handles exist, the bytes do not, until something is evaluated. Re-opening
//! `transformer/` once per window costs a header parse, not 5.18 GB. Only the tensors a window's
//! blocks actually read are materialized, and [`Weights::remove_accessed`] then drops the view's own
//! reference to exactly those. On this family that drain is measured **inert** on the request peak
//! (see [`ChromaBlockStream::materialize_double`]) — a fresh view is opened per window, so its
//! references die at the window boundary regardless — and it is kept as the shared discipline rather
//! than claimed as load-bearing on a sibling's evidence.
//!
//! ## What rung 4 does NOT bound here
//!
//! The pruned-adaLN trunk stays resident: `x_embedder`, `context_embedder`, `proj_out` and the whole
//! dense `distilled_guidance_layer` Approximator (a 5-deep residual stack plus its per-layer norm
//! vectors, deliberately kept dense at every tier). Those run once per step and are not block
//! weights; the window addresses `transformer_blocks.{n}` / `single_transformer_blocks.{n}` and
//! never touches them.
//!
//! ## Adapter replay
//!
//! A window rebuilt from the snapshot would silently drop the LoRA/LoKr residuals installed at load
//! — a plausible wrong image with no error anywhere. Chroma installs every adapter as a
//! forward-time residual on an [`AdaptableLinear`], so replaying the captured per-block list
//! reproduces the resident block exactly rather than approximating it, and a block that comes back
//! **without** a pair the resident stack had is refused loudly ([`BlockAdapters::install`] and the
//! `adapters_expected` guard below).
//!
//! Production admission is stricter still — [`crate::memory_strategy::structurally_streamable`]
//! withdraws rung 4 for any spec carrying adapters — but the replay is implemented and tested
//! regardless, because "the route is currently refused" is not a mechanism and the refusal is one
//! contract edit away from being relaxed.
