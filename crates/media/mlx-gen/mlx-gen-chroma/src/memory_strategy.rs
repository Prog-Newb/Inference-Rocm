//! The shared image-memory ladder for **Chroma1 HD / Base / Flash** on MLX/Metal (SC-15520).
//!
//! Chroma is the FLUX MMDiT skeleton with pruned adaLN — 19 double + 38 single blocks whose
//! modulation comes from a dense `distilled_guidance_layer` Approximator rather than from per-block
//! `norm*.linear` weights — plus **T5-XXL-only** conditioning and the FLUX.1 16-channel VAE. All
//! three catalog entries (`chroma1_hd`, `chroma1_base`, `chroma1_flash`) are the *same* provider
//! route: one architecture, one loader, one contract shape; they differ only in checkpoint, sampler
//! default and schedule. Nothing here is inherited from FLUX.1 or from any other family — the epic's
//! standing rule is that a rung's presence, magnitude and candidate set are per family per backend,
//! so every number this module publishes comes from
//! `tests/memory_ladder_real_weights.rs` on this Mac's Metal GPU.
//!
//! ## What each rung does here
//!
//! Measured on **Chroma1-Base q4 at 1024², Apple/Metal**, 4 steps, true CFG 4.0. Every row is a
//! fresh generator, one discarded warm-up row of the same shape, `reset_peak_memory` after the load.
//!
//! | rung | mechanism | request peak | state |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 0 resident | — | 28.0779 GiB | baseline |
//! | 1 staged residency | shed T5-XXL before the DiT/VAE load, per request | **19.2065 GiB (−31.60%)** | Implemented |
//! | 2 bounded decode | `Vae::decode_tiled` on the FLUX.1 16-ch AutoencoderKL | bounds the phase; **fails quality** | Missing, see [`DECODE_SUPPORT`] |
//! | 3 bounded attention | `sdpa_budgeted_bhsd` on both block stacks | bounds the phase; **not the binding one** | Missing, see [`ATTENTION_SUPPORT`] |
//! | 4 bounded transformer residency | `run_windowed` over the two DiT sub-stacks | **14.6932 GiB (−23.50% on rung 1)** | Implemented |
//!
//! Rung 4's saving is attributed rather than assumed: 4.5133 GiB measured against a 4.5125 GiB
//! windowable block weight set read from the snapshot's own safetensors `data_offsets` — the whole
//! set, to within 0.8 MiB, which is what a window that replaces the resident stack should buy and
//! nothing more.
//!
//! ## What measurement decided, and what it overturned
//!
//! Two verdicts here are the opposite of what the architecture suggests, and both were reached by
//! measuring rather than by reasoning from the sibling families:
//!
//! * **Rung 2 is `Missing`, on a narrow margin.** Tiling the FLUX.1 VAE decode is a large saving on
//!   this family (−11% to −72% of the decode phase). At the variant's real 28-step schedule the best
//!   of 28 swept geometries drifts **53/255** against the untiled decode of the **production**
//!   latent, ~10% over the 48/255 bar the closest sibling admits — and resampling that cell across
//!   five production latents gives 28..82, a 2.9x spread that straddles the bar. Withheld as an
//!   UNRESOLVED margin, not as a clean failure. See [`DECODE_SUPPORT`].
//! * **Rung 3 is `Missing`.** MLX's fused attention kernel streams its scores, so query-row
//!   chunking has no materialized score matrix to bound: measured **−0.001%** on the request peak.
//!   See [`ATTENTION_SUPPORT`].
//! * **Rung 4 is scoped at the `Dit`, not the text encoder.** Chroma's shipped q4 tier packs only
//!   the DiT block linears, so the T5-XXL encoder is the largest single component (dense bf16, 10.15
//!   GiB against a 7.14 GiB packed DiT) — which makes the text-encoder scope look obviously right
//!   and is exactly why it needed measuring. Rung 1 has already shed the encoder before the heavy
//!   phase loads, so the request peak is the heavy phase and a `TextEncoder` window moves it by
//!   **−0.00%**. See [`TRANSFORMER_WINDOW_COMPONENT`].
//!
//! sc-16462 (inference PR #443) packs the T5/VAE auxiliaries. It changes the conditioning phase's
//! weight, so every conditioning number here is re-derived when it lands — but it does not disturb
//! either verdict, because rung 1 already removes that phase from the request peak and rung 2's
//! rejection is a decoder-quality result that a narrower text encoder does not touch.
