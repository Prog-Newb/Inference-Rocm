//! What the `-base` registrations are actually for: real classifier-free guidance and a real
//! negative prompt (sc-14546).
//!
//! # The claim this file had to correct before it could gate anything
//!
//! sc-14546 was written on the premise that the base checkpoints are "the only checkpoints where
//! `cfg_scale` and `negative_prompt` do anything". At the level of the ported graph that is false:
//! [`candle_audio_stable_audio_3::dit`]'s guided forward takes its batch-1 shortcut when
//! `cfg_scale == 1.0` and on no other condition, so at any other guidance the identical batch-2
//! CFG / APG / rescale path runs on a post-trained checkpoint too. Upstream's "no effect on
//! post-trained checkpoints" is a statement about what distillation did to the weights.
//!
//! What *is* true, and what this file pins, is that `1.0` is the crate's post-trained default and
//! `7.0` is the base default — so a default post-trained request genuinely ignores its negative
//! prompt and a default base request genuinely does not. Both halves are asserted, in the same run,
//! against the same checkpoint.
//!
//! # What the divergence assertion proves, and what it does not
//!
//! "A negative prompt changes the output" is only evidence if the change is bigger than the
//! implementation's own numerical disagreement with the reference. So the divergence gate measures
//! that disagreement first: it replays the frozen-Torch guidance oracle
//! (`docs/migration/sa3-sampler-reference/guidance.safetensors`) on this exact checkpoint, device
//! and dtype, records the largest per-element gap against the reference, and then requires the
//! negative-prompt divergence — measured in the same latent space, from the same initial noise, at
//! the same single Euler step — to exceed it.
//!
//! Be honest about the strength of that comparison. The floor is an *agreement* quantity (order
//! `1e-3`); the divergence is a *signal* quantity (order `1e2`). The only alternative it
//! distinguishes is a divergence of exactly zero — negative threading deleted outright. A
//! mis-wired-but-non-zero negative branch — conditional and unconditional halves swapped, the
//! guidance weight applied as `g` where it should be `g - 1`, the negative attention mask dropped —
//! diverges just as loudly and would sail through it. No frozen-Torch artifact covers the explicit
//! negative path (`guidance.safetensors` carries only `None`-negative renders), so parity cannot
//! close that hole either.
//!
//! What closes it is the recomposition identity in
//! [`the_guided_latents_are_exactly_the_cfg_recomposition_of_their_own_two_branches`]: with
//! `apg_scale = 0`, `cfg_norm_threshold = 0` and `scale_phi = 0`, `guided_prediction` reduces to
//! `uncond + g * (cond - uncond)` in v-space, and a single Euler step is affine in the model
//! output, so the guided latents must equal `L(N) + g * (L(P) - L(N))` where `L(P)` and `L(N)` are
//! the batch-1 `cfg_scale = 1.0` steps on the positive and the *masked* negative embeddings. That
//! prediction is compared against three named mis-wirings of the same two branches, so it fails on
//! each of them.
