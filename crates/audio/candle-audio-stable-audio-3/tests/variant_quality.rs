//! What medium's registration can and cannot claim against the two specialists (`sc-14545`).
//!
//! # What this establishes
//!
//! 1. **Both domains reach medium.** `stable_audio_3_medium` is the only released SA3 checkpoint
//!    Stability tags for `music` *and* `sound-effects`; `small-music` and `small-sfx` are
//!    specialists. This renders medium on a shipped music `demo_cond` prompt and a shipped SFX
//!    `demo_cond` prompt and requires both to satisfy the same validity gates — non-silent, finite,
//!    clamped, genuinely two-channel, neither white noise nor a pure tone.
//! 2. **Medium is a distinct checkpoint from each specialist.** On identical prompt, seed, duration
//!    and step count, medium's waveform must diverge from the specialist's by an envelope measured
//!    *here*, over three seeds per domain — not the one `tests/variant_divergence.rs` calibrated for
//!    the same-architecture music/SFX pair, which turns out to reject honest output on this pairing.
//!    A mis-wired registration serving small weights under the medium id would produce valid audio
//!    and pass every other gate in this crate; only a divergence gate catches it.
//! 3. **A measured character table**, printed for every render so a future change is diagnosable.
//!
//! # What this does NOT establish
//!
//! It does **not** establish that medium sounds better. The story's original wording asked for
//! "audibly higher quality than `small_music`", and no metric in this file — or any objective metric
//! that fits in a test — can carry that. `MR-STFT` and SNR measure *agreement with a reference*, and
//! there is no reference: two different checkpoints rendering the same prompt are supposed to
//! disagree.
//!
//! That wording is now **retired** rather than merely unclaimed. `sc-15178` pins what a rigorous
//! perceptual claim would take — `docs/migration/SC_15178_SA3_LISTENING_PROTOCOL.md`, with the
//! stimulus generator in `tests/listening_stimuli.rs` and the blinding/analysis helper in
//! `scripts/audio/sa3_listening_blind.py` — and the protocol is designed but **not executed**;
//! running it needs a human panel and is tracked as `sc-15377`. Until that reports, the "audibly
//! higher quality" wording stands retired in favour of the capability claim below, and it is
//! reinstated only by a panel result, never by a metric.
//!
//! **Nothing in sc-14545 claims medium is perceptually superior.** What is claimed is the
//! capability difference, which is objective and enforced elsewhere: medium renders up to 380 s
//! where the smalls stop at 120 s (`tests/conformance.rs`), it decodes through the 852M SAME-L
//! rather than the 108M SAME-S, and it serves both domains rather than one.
//!
//! The bound in this file must therefore never be re-read as a quality bar: it is a mis-wiring
//! detector. See `SC_15178_SA3_LISTENING_PROTOCOL.md` §1 for why any agreement threshold wide
//! enough to admit honest cross-checkpoint output also admits an unrelated take.
