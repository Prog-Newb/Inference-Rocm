//! Stable Audio 3 provider foundation, shared primitives, and the registered providers.
//!
//! Six checkpoints are registered, in this order:
//!
//! - [`MODEL_ID`] (`stable_audio_3_small_music`, sc-14543) — 433M text-to-music, SAME-S, 120 s;
//! - [`SFX_MODEL_ID`] (`stable_audio_3_small_sfx`, sc-14544) — 433M text-to-sound-effects / Foley,
//!   SAME-S, 120 s;
//! - [`MEDIUM_MODEL_ID`] (`stable_audio_3_medium`, sc-14545) — 1.45B differential DiT over SAME-L,
//!   380 s;
//! - [`MUSIC_BASE_MODEL_ID`], [`SFX_BASE_MODEL_ID`], [`MEDIUM_BASE_MODEL_ID`] (sc-14546) — the
//!   pre-trained flow-matching checkpoints behind the three above.
//!
//! All six share the bundled encoder-only T5Gemma stack, 44.1 kHz stereo output, and the same
//! guidance surface; every load is variant-bound through [`model::load_variant`].
//!
//! # What the `-base` half actually changes
//!
//! Not the descriptor. Both `supports_negative_prompt` and `supports_guidance` have been `true` for
//! every post-trained id since sc-14544, because [`dit::StableAudio3Dit::forward_guided`] takes its
//! batch-1 shortcut on `cfg_scale == 1.0` and never on the checkpoint. Upstream's "these parameters
//! have no effect on post-trained checkpoints" describes what post-training did to the weights, not
//! a branch in the graph.
//!
//! What changes is the operating point a request resolves to when it omits a field:
//!
//! | | objective | omitted sampler | omitted steps | omitted guidance |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | post-trained | `rf_denoiser` | Pingpong | 8 | 1.0 |
//! | `-base` | `rectified_flow` | Euler | 50 | 7.0 |
//!
//! The sampler column is upstream's own rule ([`sampler::SamplerKind::recommended`]), which was
//! dead code on the provider path until sc-14546. The steps and guidance columns are a **product
//! choice** — upstream's Python and CLI defaults stay 8 / 1.0 for every checkpoint — taken from the
//! base configs' own `training.demo` block and from Stability's Gradio app. See
//! [`pipeline::BASE_DEFAULT_STEPS`].
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! The two smalls are architecturally identical to each other, so only the conditioner `repo_id`
//! and the pinned file hashes separate them. Medium is a different graph — `1536x24` differential
//! attention, 997 root tensors, a `16,777,216`-frame ceiling — so its wrapper rejects a small
//! snapshot on shape before identity ever comes up. See [`model::VariantShape`].
//!
//! Across the post-trained/base split the conditioner `repo_id` discriminates **nothing** — every
//! base config declares its post-trained sibling's repository — so `diffusion_objective` is the only
//! universal discriminator and is carried per variant in [`pipeline::VariantGeometry`], alongside a
//! separate provenance field. For the medium pair it is the only config-level difference that
//! exists, which leaves the SHA-256 root pin as the rest of the gate.
//!
//! # Domain coverage is documentation-only
//!
//! Stability tags `stable_audio_3_medium` for **both** `music` and `sound-effects`; the two smalls
//! are single-domain specialists. `stable_audio_3_small_sfx` additionally overlaps in intent with
//! the shipped `moss_sfx_v2` provider but is a different tier and output shape: SA3 SFX is
//! **44.1 kHz stereo**, MOSS-SoundEffect is **48 kHz mono**. The descriptor contract cannot
//! machine-encode domain, channel count, or quality tier today, so those distinctions live in the
//! ids and in these notes and nowhere else. sc-14545 accepts that explicitly rather than claiming
//! typed coverage; adding the typed fields is tracked as `sc-15041`.
//!
//! `candle-audio-catalog` composes this crate into every shipped audio runtime bundle:
//!
//! - [`config`] parses both upstream `model_config.json` families and applies the frozen Python
//!   constructor defaults, including DyT for SAME-S and SAME-L;
//! - [`weights`] recognizes only caller-provisioned snapshot directories, validates their
//!   safetensors headers, and maps the two checkpoint namespaces;
//! - [`transformer`] implements the ordinary and direct-subtraction differential transformer
//!   primitives shared by the DiT and SAME families;
//! - [`pretransform`], [`softnorm`], and [`weight_norm`] cover the shared autoencoder seams;
//! - [`t5gemma`] implements the bundled encoder-only T5Gemma text conditioner;
//! - [`prepare`] provides the catalog-composed dense passthrough implementation.
//!
//! Shared audio functionality stays in [`candle_audio`]. Consumers should use
//! [`candle_audio::dsp::resample`] for sample-rate conversion rather than adding provider-local DSP.
//!
//! # Audio→audio restyle (sc-14547)
//!
//! All six ids advertise [`gen_core::ConditioningKind::ReferenceAudio`]: pass an existing recording
//! plus a prompt and the source is conformed to the model's 44.1 kHz stereo timeline, SAME-encoded,
//! and mixed into the sampler's initial noise instead of starting from pure noise. Off-rate source
//! audio is **resampled**, not rejected — the rest of this lane emits 48 kHz.
//!
//! `Conditioning::ReferenceAudio.strength` is **retention**-oriented on this family, matching the
//! workspace's mflux-derived img2img convention: `1.0` returns the prepared source without a DiT
//! forward, `0.0` is pure generation, and an omitted value resolves to
//! [`model::DEFAULT_REFERENCE_STRENGTH`]. The sampler's own `strength` is upstream's
//! `init_noise_level` and runs the *other* way; the single conversion between the two lives in
//! [`model::reference_noise_level`]. Its sign is pinned by **three** mutation gates in
//! `tests/reference_audio.rs`, one per seam the value crosses, because a correct conversion whose
//! result never travels is the same bug by another route: the conversion itself; the field selection
//! in [`model::reference_audio_for`], which carries the converted value into the pipeline; and
//! [`pipeline::sampler_strength_for`], which decides the scalar the sampler is handed. Each is
//! verified to fail under its own single-token mutation. That chain is continuous from
//! `GenerationRequest` to the sampler `strength` argument; past that argument
//! (`build_schedule`/`initialize_latents`) the sampler's own oracles take over. See
//! `docs/migration/SC_14547_REFERENCE_AUDIO_RESTYLE.md`.
