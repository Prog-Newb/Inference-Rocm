//! Load-time adapter stacking for Stable Audio 3 — the full eight-type family.
//!
//! Upstream Stable Audio 3 ships a first-class adapter ecosystem, and it is **not** classic LoRA
//! only. Eight canonical types plus one legacy alias are trained and published against these
//! checkpoints, and this module implements all of them:
//!
//! | type | delta | post-transform |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`AdapterType::Lora`] | `(α/r)·s·(B @ A)` | none |
//! | [`AdapterType::DoraRows`] | as above | row-normalize, rescale by `magnitude_r` |
//! | [`AdapterType::DoraCols`] | as above | column-normalize, rescale by `magnitude_c` |
//! | [`AdapterType::Bora`] | as above | rows, then columns |
//! | [`AdapterType::LoraXs`] | `(α/r)·s·(U @ M @ Vᵀ)` | none |
//! | [`AdapterType::DoraRowsXs`] | as `LoraXs` | rows |
//! | [`AdapterType::DoraColsXs`] | as `LoraXs` | columns |
//! | [`AdapterType::BoraXs`] | as `LoraXs` | rows, then columns |
//!
//! `dora` is a legacy alias resolved by sniffing which magnitude tensor the file carries, defaulting
//! to [`AdapterType::DoraRows`] — which is also upstream's training default, so it is the type most
//! real artifacts will be.
//!
//! `U` and `V` for the `-xs` half are the top-`r` singular vectors of the **base weight**, not
//! tensors in the adapter file. Candle has no SVD, so [`crate::svd`] provides a deterministic host
//! one; read its module docs before touching anything `-xs`.
//!
//! # Order is load-bearing here, unlike the image lane
//!
//! Classic LoRA deltas commute: `W + δ₁ + δ₂` is order-free, which is why the image providers can
//! fold a stack into a map and not care. **DoRA and BoRA do not commute.** The strength participates
//! *inside* the normalization — `magnitude · (W + s·δ) / ‖W + s·δ‖` is not linear in `δ` — so
//! swapping two adapters in a stack produces genuinely different weights. [`AdapterPlan::build`]
//! therefore preserves [`candle_audio::gen_core::LoadSpec::adapters`] order exactly and
//! [`apply_adapter_ops`] folds strictly sequentially, each adapter seeing the previous one's output
//! as its base.
//!
//! One consequence worth stating because it is a real choice and not a derivation: for a stacked
//! `-xs` adapter, the SVD bases come from the weight **as it enters that adapter**, not from the
//! pristine checkpoint weight. That is the reading under which "fold sequentially" and "attach
//! parametrizations sequentially" are the same operation. It is *not* verified against an upstream
//! artifact, because none exists on this machine — see the honesty note at the bottom of these docs.
//!
//! # Targets
//!
//! The DiT (`model.…`) and the registered conditioner modules (`conditioner.…`). Two structural
//! facts keep the forbidden targets out rather than a check that could be deleted:
//!
//! * **T5Gemma lives in a different file.** The text encoder is `t5gemma-b-b-ul2/model.safetensors`,
//!   a separate mmap with a separate [`candle_nn::VarBuilder`]. [`AdapterBackend`] wraps only the
//!   root checkpoint's backend, so no adapter can reach a T5 tensor by any key it could name.
//! * **SAME is excluded by prefix.** `pretransform.…` is in the root file, so it is excluded
//!   explicitly by [`is_adaptable_target`] and an adapter naming one fails loudly.
//!
//! # Formats, and the security boundary
//!
//! Accepted: a native `.safetensors` file, or a PEFT directory (`adapter_model.safetensors` +
//! `adapter_config.json`). **Refused: every pickle container** — `.ckpt`, `.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin` —
//! with a typed [`candle_audio::gen_core::Error::Unsupported`]. Unpickling is arbitrary code execution, and an
//! adapter path is caller-supplied data; there is no "trusted" version of that. The same rule is
//! why the `svd_bases.pt` shipped beside the `-base` checkpoints is never read here: it is a
//! *startup cache* for a decomposition this crate computes itself, so refusing it costs nothing.
//!
//! # What is NOT claimed
//!
//! **No upstream artifact was available to validate against.** There is no Stable Audio 3 adapter
//! of any type in this machine's cache, and no published community one. Everything here is gated
//! weight-free against adapters this repository *constructs*, in the on-disk format this module
//! declares. That is enough to prove the math, the ordering, the filters, the formats and the
//! refusals; it is **not** evidence that the key spellings below match an upstream file, and no
//! such claim appears anywhere in this crate. Obtaining a real artifact is tracked as `sc-15347`.
