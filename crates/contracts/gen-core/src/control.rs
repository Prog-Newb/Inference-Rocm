//! `ControlBranch` — the backend-neutral seam shared by every **Fun-Controlnet-Union** /
//! ControlNet variant (sc-8241, epic 8236).
//!
//! A control variant (Z-Image-turbo, FLUX.2-dev, Qwen-Image — and, by design, the forthcoming
//! FLUX.1-dev branch sc-8238/sc-8239) is the base generator plus a control branch that injects a
//! VAE-encoded skeleton/depth/canny hint into the backbone's own DiT blocks. The **per-model forward
//! pass is NOT shareable**: a Fun-Controlnet-Union branch is a partial copy of each backbone's blocks
//! (FLUX.2 MMDiT / Z-Image no-RoPE MMDiT / Qwen DiT), so the residual/context math lives in the
//! provider crate. What *was* duplicated near-verbatim across all three crates — and is collapsed
//! here — is the **boilerplate** around that forward:
//!
//! - pulling the base-snapshot dir + the (required) control checkpoint out of a [`LoadSpec`], with
//!   consistent error messages,
//! - extracting the single [`Conditioning::Control`] image + its scale from a request (with the
//!   accepted-kind policy),
//! - the `validate()` tail that requires a `Control` conditioning be present.
//!
//! This trait is **tensor-free** (it touches only gen-core contract types), so it lives in gen-core
//! alongside [`crate::Generator`] and is implemented by each provider's loaded control struct. The
//! default
//! message bodies match the canonical Z-Image port; FLUX.2 / Qwen override only the few methods
//! whose wording legitimately differs, so the user-facing error text stays **byte-identical** to the
//! hand-written originals (the `#[ignore]` smokes assert on the substrings these produce).
//!
//! The trait surface is deliberately **input-agnostic**: the Fun-Union family has no discrete
//! control-mode index — pose / canny / depth differ only by the host-side preprocessor, never by a
//! branch parameter — so there is intentionally no "mode" on this seam. A new backbone (FLUX.1) plugs
//! in by implementing the same handful of methods; no trait change is required.
