//! The **shared checkpoint table** for the media lane (sc-16665) — one [`ComponentLicense`] row per
//! upstream checkpoint, read by both media catalogs.
//!
//! # PROVISIONAL — gathered by an agent, not yet signed off by a human
//!
//! Every value here was transcribed from a primary source retrieved on **2026-08-02** by an
//! automated agent, and each one is backed by a quote, a source URL and a retrieval date in
//! `docs/licensing/sc-16665-checkpoint-licence-evidence.md`. That note is the sign-off document, and
//! it also carries the [known holes](#known-holes--rows-that-were-deliberately-not-written). **No
//! human has yet checked the transcriptions.**
//!
//! # Disclosure only
//!
//! Nothing here blocks, gates, degrades or withholds anything, and nothing added here ever should. A
//! row records what an upstream **names**, never what a user may or may not do. In particular
//! [`ComponentLicense::gated`] records that an upstream put a checkpoint behind an acceptance gate —
//! it does not gate anything in this system, and no code may branch on it.
//!
//! # Why one table, shared
//!
//! A licence is a property of the checkpoint, and the MLX and Candle engines load the **same**
//! checkpoints. Only the provider→component mapping legitimately differs per backend, and that lives
//! in each media catalog ([`ProviderComponents`](super::ProviderComponents); sc-16666 for MLX,
//! sc-16667 for Candle). Keeping the rows here — tensor-neutral, beside the families they resolve
//! against and beside [`license_table_conformance_errors`](super::license_table_conformance_errors)
//! — means the two catalogs cannot drift into two different answers about one upstream artifact, and
//! a checkpoint that no provider id loads at all (the PiD decoder, the SAM stacks) still gets a row.
//!
//! # Granularity: one row per **upstream repository**
//!
//! A licence attaches to a repository, so that is the row. Two consequences the census forced:
//!
//! * **A component redistributed inside another party's snapshot is keyed on its own upstream
//!   repository, not on the redistributor's.** [`ComponentLicense::source_url`] says why in general;
//!   sc-16665 proved it concretely: `Comfy-Org/Lens` attributes its bundled FLUX.2-dev VAE as
//!   `apache-2.0`, while BFL's own gated `LICENSE.md` for that checkpoint is the FLUX Non-Commercial
//!   License v2.1. A redistributor is verifiably wrong about a component it bundles. So the Lens
//!   text encoder is the [`gpt_oss_20b`](GPT_OSS_20B) row and its VAE is the
//!   [`flux2_dev`](FLUX2_DEV) row.
//! * **A repository re-published in a second layout by the same publisher is one row.** `Wan-AI`'s
//!   `-Diffusers` siblings carry the same weights under the same declaration; the row names the base
//!   repository and its comment names the sibling. Two genuinely different models in one census line
//!   (Wan2.1-VACE 1.3B and 14B) are two rows.
//!
//! Five checkpoints genuinely need finer rows than their repository, and each is handled where it
//! occurs: `nvidia/PiD` (see [`nvidia_pid_students`](NVIDIA_PID_STUDENTS)), `ByteDance/Hyper-SD`
//! (see [`hyper_sd_flux1_dev_8steps_lora`](HYPER_SD_FLUX1_DEV_8STEPS_LORA)),
//! `Kwai-Kolors/Kolors-diffusers` (see [`chatglm3_6b`](CHATGLM3_6B)), `SceneWorks/Lens` (see
//! [`gpt_oss_20b`](GPT_OSS_20B)) and `Boogu/Boogu-Image-0.1-*` (see
//! [`boogu_image_0_1_base`](BOOGU_IMAGE_0_1_BASE)).
//!
//! # `source_url` picks the document that carries `declared`
//!
//! Two shapes, and which applies is decided by where the declaration lives rather than by taste —
//! the same rule [`ComponentLicense::source_url`] states:
//!
//! * the **repository card**, when `declared` is the card's own `license_name` or `license` tag
//!   (`apache-2.0`, `flux-non-commercial-license`, `openrail++`, `gemma`, …) — the overwhelming
//!   majority of rows;
//! * a **licence document beside the weights**, when the card declares nothing and the artifact's
//!   only declaration is that document's own title (`SAM License`, `MIT License`, `CircleStone Labs
//!   Non-Commercial License v1.0`, `The ChatGLM3-6B License`), or when the declaration lives in the
//!   README body rather than the metadata (`nvidia/PiD`).
//!
//! # `attribution` is set exactly when the family requires it
//!
//! `Some(…)` on every row whose resolved family imposes
//! [`AttributionRequired`](super::LicenseTerm::AttributionRequired), `None`
//! on every row whose family does not. The conformance gate enforces the first half; the test module
//! here enforces the second, so an attribution never silently implies an obligation the text does
//! not state. Where a licence prescribes the notice's wording, the prescribed wording is used
//! verbatim and **in full** — one text does, `ideogram-4-non-commercial` §3(iii), and both its rows
//! share one `IDEOGRAM_4_PRESCRIBED_NOTICE` constant so neither can drift into a fragment of it.
//! Otherwise the string follows the house shape the
//! audio lane established, naming the artifact, the publisher as the repository publishes it, and
//! the licence.
//!
//! # Known holes — rows that were deliberately **not** written
//!
//! The evidence is incomplete, and a fabricated row is worse than a missing one: sc-16669's ship
//! gate reports a missing row and **fails CI**, and per the epic's product constraint it never
//! withholds a provider. So a hole is loud and tracked. `known_holes_stay_absent` in this module's
//! test block pins every one of them by key, so a later row for any of these is a deliberate diff
//! rather than a silent addition. The reason classes:
//!
//! | class | what it means | examples |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | UNDETERMINED | the upstream repository could not be named | FLUX.2's Mistral3 / Pixtral / Qwen3 towers, Anima's Qwen3-0.6B, the four vendor Qwen3-VL towers, PiD's five bundled VAEs |
//! | NOT FOUND | the upstream is known and declares nothing re-readable | `Kwai-Kolors/Kolors-ControlNet-Pose`, the six `microsoft/Mage-Flow*` repos (404), `microsoft/Lens*` (404), `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14` |
//! | AMBIGUOUS | two primary sources disagree, or the family is genuinely open | `Kwai-Kolors/Kolors-diffusers` (U6), `alibaba-pai/FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union` (BFL v2.0 vs v2.1), Boogu's FLUX.1 VAE (dev vs schnell) |
//! | NO DECLARED STRING | there is no string to transcribe as `declared` — the upstream publishes prose with no identifier behind it, or no declared string was recorded by a read | the two antelopev2 rows; the SD3.5 `-large-turbo` and `-medium` siblings |
//! | SECOND-HAND ONLY | the only declaration is this repository's own record | `fancyfeast/llama-joycaption-beta-one-hf-llava`, `depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf` |
//!
//! Six questions are on Michael's sign-off list and are **not** answered here: the Boogu FLUX.1-VAE
//! dev-vs-schnell question, whether second-hand MIT is acceptable for the vanished `microsoft/*`
//! repositories and what `source_url` a dead repository gets (sc-16984), whether
//! `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14`'s `declared` is blank or `"MIT"` with GitHub provenance stated,
//! Kolors U6, whether BFL v2.0 and v2.1 are one family or two, and U11.
