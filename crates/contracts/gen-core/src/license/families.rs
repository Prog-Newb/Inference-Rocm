//! The licence **family** table (sc-16662, extended by sc-16665) — nineteen upstream licence texts,
//! transcribed.
//!
//! # PROVISIONAL — gathered by an agent, not yet signed off by a human
//!
//! Every value here was transcribed from a primary-source licence text retrieved on **2026-08-02**
//! by an automated agent, and each one is backed by a verbatim quote recorded in
//! `docs/licensing/sc-16662-licence-family-evidence.md` (the sixteen sc-16662 families) or
//! `docs/licensing/sc-16665-checkpoint-licence-evidence.md` (the three sc-16665 added). Those notes
//! are the sign-off documents: they carry the quote, the source URL and the retrieval date behind
//! every term below, plus the open items a human still has to decide. **No human has yet checked the
//! quotes.** Treat these values as provisional until the notes' sign-off tables are ticked.
//!
//! # Disclosure only
//!
//! Nothing here blocks, gates, degrades or withholds anything, and nothing added here ever should.
//! Each term records what a licence text **names**. Whether a given use is permitted is the
//! consumer's evaluation of these facts against its own situation — its revenue, whether it
//! redistributes weights, which agreements it has with its own users — and this crate has none of
//! that information. The doc comments below therefore report what a text states and stop there.
//!
//! # Silence is recorded as silence
//!
//! Where a text says nothing, the honest transcription is nothing. Four families restrict use of
//! the *weights* to non-commercial purposes and say nothing at all about **outputs**
//! (`insightface-research-only`, `nvidia-nsclv1`, `apple-mlr`, `cc-by-nc-4-0`), so none of them
//! carries [`LicenseTerm::NonCommercialOutputs`] — inferring one from a use restriction would be a
//! legal reading, and there is no quote for it. Contrast FLUX.1 \[dev\] §2(d) and CircleStone
//! §2(e), which address outputs explicitly and in the opposite direction; those are quoted, and
//! still not transcribed as a term, because the vocabulary has no "outputs are unrestricted"
//! variant and does not need one.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Families only. The component rows that point at them live beside this module in
//! [`super::components`] (sc-16665); the provider→component mappings
//! ([`super::ProviderComponents`]) are per-backend and belong to the two media catalogs (sc-16666,
//! sc-16667). A family being listed here is a statement that its text was read, **not** that a
//! shipped checkpoint declares it.
