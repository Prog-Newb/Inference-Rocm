/// component with the conservative in-memory size:
///
/// - `text_encoder` — the phase-A prompt encoder(s) that [`OffloadPolicy::Sequential`](crate::runtime::OffloadPolicy)
///   drops *before* the heavy render bundle loads (one or more, e.g. SDXL's two CLIPs, SD3's three);
/// - `dit` — the heavy transformer / U-Net (the "DiT"), the dominant render-phase component;
/// - `vae` — the autoencoder, co-resident with the DiT through the render.
///
/// Why a provider owns this rather than the consumer inferring it: the Sequential/staged peak is
/// `max(text_encoder, dit + vae)` (the encoder is freed before the renderer materializes — see
/// [`LoadPhase::Renderer`](crate::runtime::LoadPhase::Renderer)), not the resident sum. A consumer that
/// guesses the text-encoder size from `text_encoder*` subdir NAMING reads **zero** for any family whose
/// encoder is not under such a subdir — or has no separable encoder at all (a flat unified checkpoint) —
/// collapsing the staged peak back to the resident peak so no saving is ever selected. Each provider,
/// by contrast, computes the split from the exact subdir paths its own loader resolves.
///
/// The default constructors are tensor-free on-disk sums ([`crate::safetensors_dir_bytes`]) — **zero**
/// MLX allocation and no whole-file reads — so this remains safe in a pre-load gate. A component a
/// model does not have (or cannot separate) is `0`.
///
/// **On-disk byte SUMS, not load-exact.** Each field totals *every* `.safetensors` under the named
/// path(s), which can exceed what a single load materializes: one component dir may ship multiple
/// interchangeable variant files (anima's `diffusion_models/` holds the base/aesthetic/turbo DiTs, but
/// a run loads exactly one — so `dit` over-counts by the unused variants), or side-by-side dtype shards
/// (an SD3 `text_encoder_3/` carrying both f32 and fp16 double-counts). Today the worker consumes only
/// `text_encoder` plus the true whole-model total; `dit` / `vae` are **informational** for a future
