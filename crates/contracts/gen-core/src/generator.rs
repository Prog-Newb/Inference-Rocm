//! The `Generator` contract — prompt-conditioned synthesis of image, video, **or** audio
//! (or a mix), including multi-modal models. See `docs/MODEL_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.1.
//!
//! One trait covers everything text→media: T2I, T2V, edit (image+text→image), LTX
//! (text→video+audio), and pure audio synthesis (TTS / music). Modality is a
//! [`ModelDescriptor`] property plus a [`GenerationOutput`] variant — *not* a per-modality
//! trait split (which breaks on multi-modal models).
