# SceneWorks Inference

Unified source repository for SceneWorks' backend-neutral inference contracts,
MLX and Candle engines, model providers, conformance suites, and platform runtime
bundles.

## Migration status

This repository was assembled from the existing `core-llm`, `mlx-llm`,
`candle-llm`, `mlx-gen`, and `candle-gen` histories. Phase 1 preserved and
verified those histories; Phase 2 moved the imported packages into their ownership
paths and normalized them under one Cargo workspace and lockfile. Phase 3
provides dependency-aware CI selection, supply-chain policy, immutable real-weight
fixture pins, and deterministic source/SBOM release tooling.
Phase 4 adds validated `runtime-macos`, `runtime-cuda`, and `runtime-cpu` composition boundaries for
explicit media, LLM, and snapshot-preparation catalogs; the former link-time provider registries
have been removed. Phase 5 published immutable release `runtime-2026.07.0` and cut the SceneWorks
and ChatWorks lockfiles over to its exact commit. Local product validation is complete; hosted
SceneWorks validation requires its scoped credential for this private repository.

After the cutover, the legacy MLX generation repository received one further epic
(10834, sequential component residency). That post-cutover drift was reconciled into
the monorepo and published as `runtime-2026.07.2`; see
[`docs/migration/RUNTIME_2026_07_2_CHECKPOINT.md`](docs/migration/RUNTIME_2026_07_2_CHECKPOINT.md).
Legacy development is halted pending the durable decision on whether the monorepo is
the sole live development line.

The current authoritative migration plan and release-set baseline live in the
SceneWorks repository under `documents/rearchitecture/`.

## Documentation

Start in [`docs/`](docs/README.md). The essentials:

- **[Getting Started](docs/guide/getting-started.md)** — how a product depends on a runtime
  bundle, builds its validated registries, and loads/runs media generators, LLMs, and
  snapshot preparers.
- **[Model Catalog Reference](docs/reference/model-catalog.md)** — every shipped provider id
  per platform, with the MLX/Candle deltas.
- **[Architecture Rationale](docs/architecture/inference-rearchitecture.md)** — why the
  repositories were consolidated, why provider discovery is explicit, the alternatives
  considered, and the tradeoffs accepted.

See [`docs/migration/PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT.md`](docs/migration/PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT.md)
for normalization invariants and
[`docs/migration/PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT.md`](docs/migration/PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT.md) for
the published release-train evidence, and
[`docs/migration/PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT.md`](docs/migration/PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT.md) for
the explicit bundle composition and platform results.

Contribution boundaries and security reporting are documented in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
