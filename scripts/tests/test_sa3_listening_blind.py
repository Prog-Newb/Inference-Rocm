"""Gate the SA3 listening panel's blinding, scoring and pre-registered analysis (sc-15178).

`scripts/audio/sa3_listening_blind.py` is the executable half of
`docs/migration/SC_15178_SA3_LISTENING_PROTOCOL.md`. Two properties in it are load-bearing and
would otherwise be prose:

* **The blinding actually blinds.** A playlist that leaks a variant name, a prompt, or the
  generator's variant-bearing filenames is not a blinded playlist, and a panel run on one measures
  expectation rather than audio.
* **A failed ABX suppresses the preference result.** ABX answers discriminability and MOS answers
  preference; sc-14545's acceptance asks the second, and the first gates it. Reporting a preference
  between two takes listeners cannot tell apart manufactures a finding out of noise. The tests below
  drive the analyzer with a simulated null panel and require `mos` to come back `None`.

The power numbers are re-derived here from an independent closed form rather than compared against
themselves, so a mutation to the analysis constants cannot pass by also mutating the expectation.
