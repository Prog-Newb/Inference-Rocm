"""Pinned producer environment for the MMAudio parity-fixture generator (sc-17285).

The committed fixtures under `crates/audio/candle-audio-mmaudio/tests/fixtures/` record the
PyTorch reference's *numbers*, and those move with the stack that produced them — torch most of
all. So the stack is pinned rather than merely reported: `mmaudio_reference.py dump` validates the
running interpreter against this module and refuses to regenerate anything from an environment that
does not match, and the fixture metadata carries the validated versions so a future reader can tell
what produced them.

Keep this aligned with `crates/audio/candle-audio-mmaudio/_vendor/requirements-oracles.in`, which is
the hash-locked install side of the same contract;
`scripts/tests/test_mmaudio_reference.py` fails in ordinary CI if the two drift.
