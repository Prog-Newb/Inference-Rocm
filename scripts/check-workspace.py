# env-side-channel pins) turn that contract into an enforced boundary. See

# No network/HTTP client may resolve anywhere in the graph. Mirrors the `inventory` whole-graph
# ban above: a client reachable through an enabled third-party feature (e.g. a candle `hf-hub`
# feature) would reopen self-fetch, so pin the feature off rather than weaken this. All nine are
# confirmed absent on main; extend this set, never trim it. If a denied crate ever becomes a

# on an otherwise non-conforming adopter passed; so did `#[allow(unused)] use
# mlx_gen_pid::decode_routes;`. A gate whose stated purpose is to replace doc-comment enforcement must
# not be satisfiable by a doc comment, so matching now happens on COMMENT-STRIPPED source and requires
# call syntax.
#
# `DecodeRoutes::new` is the *checked* constructor: since sc-15775 it returns `Result` and refuses a
# native ladder that reaches into the PiD student's tile domain, so calling it (or
# `assert_decode_routes`, its panicking test-suite form) is at once the construction evidence and the
# conformance evidence. There is deliberately no third, separately-skippable conformance call to look
# for — requiring one would be ceremony now that construction cannot be performed unchecked.

# adopter that builds its `MemoryParameterRanges` through a shared helper never writes that literal.
# What it cannot delegate is the executable half — its own `MemoryRequestScope::configure_decode`, the

    """Whether this provider's contract textually declares ``BoundedDecode`` support **Missing**.

    Keyed on the **positive claim**. The first revision keyed the exemption on the *absence* of the
    ``decode_tile_edges`` / ``decode_overlaps`` literals, which review defeat (B) broke by building
    ``MemoryParameterRanges`` in another crate while declaring rung 2 **Implemented**: absence of
    evidence was doing the work of evidence.

    Takes the per-file evidence rather than the concatenated crate, because the const hop must be
    **scoped**. Resolving ``DECODE_SUPPORT`` by a crate-wide search let a dead or deprecated sibling
    const of the same name satisfy a live ``Implemented`` arm in another module (SC-15525 probe, root
    cause D). One hop, same file, or no exemption.

    Scoping to the file was necessary and **not sufficient**, which the first hardening pass claimed
    and a second review caught: the hop still searched for the ``= Missing`` *spelling*, so an inner
    ``mod deprecated_v1`` holding a dead ``DECODE_SUPPORT = Missing`` beside a live
    ``DECODE_SUPPORT = Implemented`` in the same file satisfied it. The hop now collects every
    declaration of that name in the file and requires **exactly one**, then checks that one's value.
    Two declarations mean this reader cannot know which the arm binds — it resolves no module paths —
    and "cannot prove it is Missing" gets the same answer as "not exempt".

    Three rules, each closing a defeated shape:

    1. **No ``Implemented`` may appear in any ``BoundedDecode`` arm line.** This is what catches the
       or-pattern and the ``>=`` guard, without this reader having to parse either.
    2. **Exactly one support arm may exist in the whole crate.** A dead ``Missing`` arm parked beside
       a live one — in a ``deprecated_v1`` module, or generated by a macro — is how root cause E
       turned a real ``Implemented`` declaration into an exemption.
    3. The single arm resolves to ``Missing`` inline, or one hop through a ``const`` **declared in the
       same file**.

    Named limitation: a macro that *generates* the support arms leaves no ``BoundedDecode`` token to
    inspect. Rule 2 turns that into "zero arms found" and therefore no exemption, which is the safe
    answer; but a macro-generated `Implemented` paired with a hand-written `Missing` arm elsewhere
    would satisfy rule 2. The registry conformance walk covers the semantic declaration, and that is
    where a macro adopter has to be caught — a text gate cannot expand macro bodies.

def check_pid_decode_route_adoption(metadata: dict, root: Path) -> None:
    """A PiD-eligible provider that adopts bounded decode must declare its routes through the shared
    ``mlx_gen_pid::DecodeRoutes`` (sc-15775).

    ``mlx_gen_pid::engine::selected_decode_tiling`` is a shared, provider-agnostic seam. Native VAE
    tile edges (256-768 output px) and PiD tile edges (512px-aligned, 1024..=4096) are disjoint by
    construction, because the student decodes a ``scale x`` super-resolved output. A provider that
    emits its native ladder into ``GenerationMemory::decode_tile_edge`` therefore turns a working
    ``use_pid`` + bounded-decode request into a hard ``budget::validate_tile`` rejection at generate
    time — and the seam must not paper over it, because silently re-planning would execute a different
    strategy than the selector chose.

    ``DecodeRoutes::new`` accepts only the native ladder and, since sc-15775, *refuses to construct* one
    that reaches into the PiD domain — so an overlapping declaration never becomes a value. That helps
    only a provider that calls it, so this is the tripwire for one that does not: it lives here, in a
    lane that fires on any workspace change, so the next adopter cannot opt out by simply not reaching
    for the shared type.

    Armed by two facts: a direct ``mlx-gen-pid`` dependency (PiD-eligible) and a
    ``register_memory_strategy`` call (its contract is resolvable, so a selector can choose a strategy
    for it), plus any sign of rung-2 adoption in the crate's own sources
    (``PID_RUNG_TWO_MARKERS``). A provider missing the first two cannot reach the hazard and is not
    asked to declare routes.

    What it verifies, precisely — and no more:

    * the crate's comment-stripped sources contain a *call* to the checked constructor, and
    * a *call* to ``validate`` on a route-named receiver.

    Both are call-syntax matches on production code with comments and literals blanked, which closes
    the three defeats the
    adversarial review found in the first revision (a ``// TODO`` mentioning ``DecodeRoutes``, an unused
    ``use``, and a trigger set narrow enough to miss a helper-built ``MemoryParameterRanges``).

    It remains a *static text* check, so its limits are named rather than implied away:

    1. It cannot prove the ``validate`` call is reached on every admission path — only that one exists.
       The weights-free registry conformance walk verifies that behaviour directly through
       ``MemoryRegistration::safety_check`` and the contract's ``pid_decode_routes`` declaration.
    2. The rung-2 trigger is a *text* proxy for the semantic fact "this provider's contract publishes
       non-empty ``decode_tile_edges``". A provider could in principle delegate every textual trace of
       rung 2 — the ranges, the strategy name, and its ``configure_decode`` hook — to another crate. The
       registry walk covers the semantic declaration; the trigger set remains deliberately wide
       (fail-closed) as an earlier diagnostic.
    3. The two *exemptions* below are narrower than the trigger set, and each is keyed on a positive,
       checkable claim rather than on an absence — because SC-15525's review showed an
       absence-keyed exemption is defeated by moving the absent text into another crate. Every
       exemption additionally requires that **both** decode seams a provider can write refuse
       unconditionally: the ``configure_decode`` trait method *and* the closure handed to
       ``MlxRequestScopeConfig::new``. The latter is the one that matters in practice — no MLX
       provider writes the former.
    4. It is a **text** gate, and two things stay outside its reach by construction. A ``macro_rules``
       expansion that generates the support arms or the ``configure_decode`` impl leaves no tokens to
       inspect; and a helper in another crate that builds a scope config is not this crate's source.
       Both are handled by *arming* rather than exempting — an unresolvable construction, or zero
       support arms, both fail closed — but neither can be positively verified here. The weights-free
       registry conformance walk is what covers the semantic declaration.

    String/character literals and constructs that cannot compile without the Rust ``test`` cfg are
    excluded from evidence matching. Trigger matching uses a separate cfg-unblanked syntax stream,
    so a parser overmatch can fail closed but cannot silently disarm the gate.

def check_snapshot_path_derivation(root: Path) -> None:
    """Fail when a snapshot/cache path is derived from ``$HOME`` with no override in the chain.

    ``check_rust_sources`` already bans HF-cache *references* under epic 13657, but only in
    production ``src/``. The same defect survived in test harnesses, where nothing linted it: a
    resolver that reads ``$HOME`` unconditionally means pointing an env var at a real store reads
    somewhere else entirely, and the suite skips or mis-resolves **while still reporting green**.
    That is the failure mode worth a gate — a red row says "fix me", a silently-skipped one says
    nothing at all.

    Two shapes hide behind a naive ``grep`` for ``env::var("HOME")`` and only one is a defect:

    * **Fallback** — an override is read first and ``$HOME`` is only the default. Harmless, and the
      shape this repo's own passing harnesses use.
    * **Derivation** — no override anywhere in the resolution chain.

    What this enforces, precisely, and no more: a ``$HOME`` read in a function that **also** joins a
    store-shaped literal (``SNAPSHOT_STORE_LITERAL``) and reads **no** other env var. All three
    conditions are needed. Dropping the store-literal one re-flags every bare ``fn home()`` accessor
    and every ``~/``-expander; dropping the env-read one re-flags every legitimate
    ``env::var(NAME).unwrap_or_else(|_| home.join(…))``.

    Two residual gaps, named rather than implied away:

    1. It is **function-scoped**, so a resolver that reads its override in one function and joins
       ``$HOME`` in another reads as a derivation. No such site exists today — the accessor shapes
       in `mlx-gen-scail2` and `mlx-gen-krea-realtime` join nothing and are excluded by the store
       literal — but a future one would need the override moved into the joining function, or an

def check_test_temp_dir_guards(root: Path) -> None:
    """Fail when test code builds a fixture path from ``env::temp_dir()`` instead of a guard.

    The defect this closes is narrow and was measured, not assumed. A helper that writes
    ``env::temp_dir().join(format!("{prefix}-{pid}"))`` and cleans up with a trailing
    ``remove_dir_all`` looks tidy on a green run — every cleanup fires — and leaks on exactly two
    paths:

    1. **The panic path.** A failing test never reaches its trailing cleanup. Measured on `mlx-llm`
       for sc-17768: eleven panicking probes left ten trees behind before the fix and none after.
    2. **Same-PID collisions.** Two `#[test]`s in one binary get the *same* ``{prefix}{pid}`` path,
       so one test's cleanup deletes a fixture another is still reading. Observed in
       `mlx-llm/tests/contract_roundtrip.rs`.

    A `tempfile` guard fixes both at once: it removes the tree while unwinding, and its suffix comes
    from OS randomness rather than a PID the OS will hand out again.

    Deliberately scoped to **test code** — `#[cfg(test)]` blocks, `#[cfg(test)] mod name;` files, and
    cargo's `tests/` `benches/` `examples/` targets. Production code that materializes into `$TMPDIR`
    (`mlx-gen-seedvr2`'s bundled negative embedding, `candle-gen`'s device-format cache root) is
    making a deliberate, reviewed choice about a process- or host-lifetime file, which is a different
    question from a fixture that should not outlive its test.

    **Scope: every unguarded test temp root, whatever its name.** An earlier revision fired only on
    a *per-run varying* name (``{pid}``, a counter, a clock) on the theory that a stable name is
    bounded at one entry and therefore usually deliberate. The measurement taken while fixing
    sc-17791 refutes that, and is the reason this is scoped as it is:

    ==========================  ==============  =====================
    lane (green run on `main`)  per-run leaked  **stable-name leaked**
    ==========================  ==============  =====================
    ``candle-audio*``                        0                   **14**
    ``candle-gen*`` + contracts             14                   **16**
    ``mlx-gen*``                            30                        0
    ==========================  ==============  =====================

    **The entire audio family's leak was stable-named — none of it was deliberate.** A per-run-only
    lint would not catch a regression of the exact thing that story fixed there. Stable names are
    also the *worse* of the two for the second hazard: a ``{pid}`` path collides only between tests
    sharing a process, while a fixed name collides across every concurrent test *and* every
    concurrent ``cargo test``, which is what deleted a live fixture mid-run in
    `mlx-llm/tests/contract_roundtrip.rs`.

    Nothing syntactic separates a deliberate artifact from a fixture root someone forgot to clean —
    only the author knows — so the author has to say. That is what the exemption below is for, and
    the sixteen genuinely-deliberate sites in the tree now carry it.

    That override is also the exemption: an ``env::var(..)``-then-fall-back reads as "the file is
    the point", whether the read is in this function or the ``unwrap_or_else`` sits downstream of a
    helper that does it.
